# GridTechWG-20100225

[Grid Technical Working Group](/wiki/spaces/BeSTGRID/pages/3816950451): meeting February 25, 2010.

## Program

In the first part of the meeting, Richard Hosking will present what he has achieved in his summer scholarship project at the University of Auckland Centre for eResearch.  

- The topic is: Cloud and Grid computing infrastructure as a service
- More information is available at [https://wiki.auckland.ac.nz/display/CERES/Cloud+and+Grid+computing+infrastructure+as+a+service](https://wiki.auckland.ac.nz/display/CERES/Cloud+and+Grid+computing+infrastructure+as+a+service)

In the second part, we will revisit the topic of upgrading the grid gateways (and installing new ones).

- [http://www.bestgrid.org/index.php/Setting_up_an_NG2](http://www.bestgrid.org/index.php/Setting_up_an_NG2)

I have written up documentation on installing the NGGUMS and NG2 virtual machines, aiming to make them a generic install guide.

Kevin, Aaron and Guy have been exercising this documentation heavily over the last few days.

I hope they would be able to comment on the documentation and ask additional questions - and others are welcome to join as well.

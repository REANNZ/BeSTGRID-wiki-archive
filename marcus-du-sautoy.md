BBC radio and television. Marcus is in New Zealand as a Visiting Maclaurin Fellow of the NZIMA.

## The Music of the Primes

Why did Beckham choose the number 23 shirt? How is 17 the key to the

evolutionary survival of a strange species of cicada? Prime numbers are the

atoms of arithmetic – the hydrogen and oxygen of the world of numbers.

Despite their fundamental importance to mathematics, they represent one

of the most tantalising enigmas in the pursuit of human knowledge.

Mathematics is the science of patterns. Yet the most fundamental numbers

in the subject seem to have no patterns to them at all. They seem scattered

randomly through the universe of numbers. But by looking at these numbers

in a new way, mathematicians have discovered what they believe is the

secret to the way Nature chose the primes.

- BestGRID SGI Cluster
		
- SGI cluster delivered 29th July

- Aim to have internal users on stream by mid August
- Aim to have external ssh users by end August
- BeSTGRID@HOME
		
- Trialed BOINC Clients on different Operating Systems.
- Setting up a BOINC server skeleton in a Virtual Machine.
- Applied for Domain Names for BOINC Project.
- Investigating bundling project client software and BOINC client software into one package.
- Looking at client screensaver design (OpenGl).
- Storage GRID
	
- Head node to SAN 11Gbps raw infiniband performance
- Head node to SAN iSCSI tunneled over infiniband 4Gbps performance
- SANs moved and racked in server room
- Head node moved and racked in server room
- Collaborative GRID
	
- Plans to use EVO in:
		
- remote teaching scenarios
- shared cross campus seminars

**Canterbury **
- Web based portal from JCU - Tobias @ BioMatters
	
- Early release deployed and is locally available at Canterbury
- Contract finished at end of July - oustanding 4 days before completion.
- accessible via the web and via the gateways but not in a production state just yet
- user account management is manual at the moment
- issues around long running jobs and certificate expiry is currently an issue, being discussed in most communities including APAN. Common response is that we'll find a proper solution later.
- Currently submitting to Gateway server, Vladimir working on final deployment to P575.
- Vladimir demo'd portal: [https://ngportal.canterbury.ac.nz/gridsphere/gridsphere](https://ngportal.canterbury.ac.nz/gridsphere/gridsphere)
- Setting up a separate gateway to make the P575 and BG accessible via the BeSTGRID infrastructure
	
- some preparation is required before this is ready for deployment and integration to GOC
- BlueGene is close to being deployed - launch 15th August
- AAF and IdP work
	
- Send to AAF workshop at end of August
- Vladimir to start AAF work in September
- Vladimir to lead but to look for other support within the institution
- Tobias not available for other work. Have potentially lost his skills around Globus, GridSphere, etc

**Auckland **
- Deployed 3 additional hosts into APAC GOC
	
- possible to submit jobs using Mr Bayes application
- New server arrived and installed
	
- Enterprise Xen install proceeding, waiting for full license

***New Business***
- Discussion on distributed search algorithm
	
- no distribution mechanism in place to allow a more complete implementation. While this might be technically feasible it isn't necessarily desireable.
- Neil to follow up with APAC and Pragma grids to check their experience.
- Q4 report due 20th August
	
- Nick on holiday, Paul taking a lead no finalising report and submitting to TEC

**ACTION ITEMS**
- Neil to follow up with APAC and Pragma grids to check their experience with distributed BLAST search algorithm.

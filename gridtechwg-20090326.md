# GridTechWG-20090326

[Grid Technical Working Group](/wiki/spaces/BeSTGRID/pages/3816950451): meeting March 26, 2009.

Program: 

Vladimir Mencl has been recently working with Markus on some enhancements to what Grisu templates can do.

At this meeting, Vladimir will demonstrate the new features in Grisu templates, and discuss with others what new applications could be supported on the grid.

Other attendees are requested to think about possible good candidates before the meeting - applications used by researchers in their community which could be installed on BeSTGRID resources and made available via a Grisu template.

Any additional discussion items would be very welcome.

# GridTechWG-20090430

[Grid Technical Working Group](grid-technical-working-group.md): meeting April 30, 2009.

Program:

At this meeting, we will welcome Richard Li, who has recently started as Project Manager for the new incarnation of the BeSTGRID project.

Yuriy will then present his recent work on enhancing the Grisu Command-line Client - which was just recently released as GriCli.

The new features implemented in the tool are:

1. ability to generate unique job names
2. config file to specify cmd options
3. use local proxy (no need to interactively enter myproxy password at each invocation).

Yuriy will give a presentation about:

- the new features implemented in GriCli
- what now GriCli can be used for (and what it's being used for by your users)
- what new features are planned for GriCli in the future - and what it than could be used for with these features.

Any additional suggestions will be the most welcome.

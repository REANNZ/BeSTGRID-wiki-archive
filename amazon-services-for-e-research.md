# Amazon services for e-Research

[Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/) are a service based model for provisioning:

- storage
- computing
- payments
- simple databases
- simple queueing
- people for small tasks

A series of meetings was held with [Amazon Services Evangelist Mike Culver](http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2008/02/new-zealand-tri.html), with many areas of interest for the e-Research community. Some references are noted here, with further experimentation and notes making planned.

**[Amazon Web Services Blog](http://aws.typepad.com/)** is worth watching to stay in the loop on products of interest based on Amazon Web Services, along with general introductions to related concepts and the community.

For **developers**, the **[Amazon web services Developer Connection](http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/kbcategory.jspa?categoryID=84)** site has a comprehensive set of resources.

## Storage

**[Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)](http://www.amazon.com/S3-AWS-home-page-Money/b/ref=sc_fe_l_2?ie=UTF8&node=16427261&no=3435361&me=A36L942TSJ2AJA)** allows for storage located in the Amazon data centre at low monthly charges with no upfront costs. More information is available on the [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com) site.

***Computation***
**[http://www.amazon.com/b/ref=sc_fe_l_2?ie=UTF8&node=201590011&no=3435361&me=A36L942TSJ2AJA Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud](http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/kbcategory.jspa?categoryID=46)** provides virtualised compute systems, based on Amazon Machine Images. These systems come in different sizes, that largest of which would suit varied computation needs well.

**[Amazon Machine Images](http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/kbcategory.jspa?categoryID=101)** are available for a wide variety of applications, from base operating systems, to Linux / Apache / MySQL / PhP bundles, to specific applications supporting e-Research.

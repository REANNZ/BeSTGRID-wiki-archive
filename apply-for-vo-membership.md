# Apply for VO Membership

`Getting Started Roadmap`

# Introduction

A Virtual Organisation (VO), or in a more informally, a "group", is a collection of people with permission to access particular services.

By joining a group, and having your request accepted, you gain access to the services associated with that group. **This is done through ****[Grix](https://reannz.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=BeSTGRID&title=Grix&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=3816950526)****.**

The default BeSTGRID VO is the `/ARCS/BeSTGRID` group, it provides access to all the 'freely shared' resources provided by BeSTGRID. Other groups provide increased levels of access to specific resources for a specific project, team, or institution associated to those VOs. In the procedure below `/ARCS/BeSTGRID` will be used as an example, just subsitute a different VO to apply for membership.

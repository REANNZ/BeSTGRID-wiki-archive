### BeSTGRID Community

#### Outreach

- BeSTGRID / eResearch presentations
- : 28 October, HortResearch Ruakura, Hamilton, Mark and Nick
- : 7 Nov, Social Statistics Research Group, COMPASS, Nick
- eResearch Australia (Melbourne)
- : trans Tasman BOF
- : [http://wiki.karen.net.nz/index.php/Trans_Tasman_eResearch_BOF_September_2008](http://wiki.karen.net.nz/index.php/Trans_Tasman_eResearch_BOF_September_2008)
- KAREN champions outreach
- : KAREN Champions Hui
- : Several Sakai sites being established from raised awareness at hui
- : Ongoing collaboration to be supported via Sakai for this group.
- : Notes on KAREN Wiki soon, discussions will continue on KAREN wiki - [http://wiki.karen.net.nz/index.php/KAREN_champions_hui](http://wiki.karen.net.nz/index.php/KAREN_champions_hui)
- PDCAT
- : Nick presenting on BeSTGRID
- : Mark presenting on eResearch tools/apps
- : John Hine introducting Carl Kesselman ([http://www.isi.edu/~carl/](http://www.isi.edu/~carl/))
- : Chris Messom is presenting on GPU computation
- AusGrid '09, 20-23 Jan 2009
- : Coincident with Aus/NZ Computer Science week.
- : Robin/Vlad thinking about it
- REANNZ
- : Survey being conducted by external consultants to inform the business/investment case to government for KAREN
- : Noted that additional funding requirements on institutions creates opportunity cost of investment in leveraging KAREN, slowing ability to subsume KAREN.
- : Interested in understanding through historical examples the time horizons for innovations to move from research sector to consumer market or to have mainstream economic impact. Have contact details for those interested in airing their opinions. Is a good opportunity to ensure a clear eResearch message is heard by those thinking about the investment case for KAREN.
- : Survey being done by Temple Investments. Looking for input on 'effect of R&E networking on NZ.
- : Nick: comment on opportunity costs if Advanced Network charges increase. Extra support costs for Universities increases the network related overheads, leaving less money to support capability building within research groups. Problem: Universities shouldn't be subsidising costs of KAREN expansion into Schools.
- : Robert: timeframes - CRI return on investment timeframes are even shorter than Universities.  Too short to see a return on a large internal investment. REANNZ seems to be focusing more on Education (i.e. a wider reach, hence more users).
- : We need to get our VCs and CEOs to do some lobbying to support their investments in eResearch.  VCs seem unaware of this change in REANNZ.

#### Funding

- MoRST funding
	
- update on discussions with Carl Penwarden, MoRST re grid middleware funding.  See below, under 'New Business.'

#### Institutional Reports

#### = Auckland=

- GridFTP progress - have a test node now, deploying GridFTP on AIX, with support from Globus team. Will test with Globus team for performance, and then be testing trans Tasman with synchrotron and others.
- Video Conferencing for Math symposium today - Andrey organising.
- Arranging Video Conference with conference in Melbourne in February, for local event: Darwin Symposium, with Bioinformatics Institute
- Have ordered new hardware to add redundancy to the virtual machine front ends to the grid, as reaching capacity. Will require considerable reorganisation to implement
- Licenses received for 32 CPUs for StarP (MatLab, Python), which will be deployed onto the BeSTGRID Auckland Cluster
- Trialing gold protein docking software, looking at building a virtual screening pipeline.
- Have initial draft report on BeSTGRID Auckland storage network utilisation, which once finalised will share with SC
- BeSTGRID Auckland Cluster seeing high levels of utilisation [are making case for further investment by ITS next year.
- : A lot of work ongoing closely with science groups to migrate code to cluster, optimise, etc.
- Local grisu frontend setup to do some development
- Hosting Anthony Bietz, new Technical Manager at Monash, on 10/11th November. Anthony was project leader for ARCHER and is involved in several of the AAF working groups (auEduPerson, sharetoken).
- : Strong interest in holding a BeSTGRID seminar with Anthony during his visit.  Nick will plan a session with BeSTGRID Tue 11 morning

#### = Massey=

- Institute IT staff training: Martin and Anton are training 3 IT consultants on GRID and cluster administration
	
- Aiming for handover of day to day responsibilities to Institute IT team
- Handover to University IT services in the future
- Ian Bond's Microlensing Astronomy team interested in GRID enabling their systems
	
- Currently using a range of client server and web services technology
- SRB services would be of interest
- Cluster upgrade approved by CoS, heading towards Council approval

#### = Canterbury=

- Big push in last month in improving Campus HD videoconferencing.
	
- (Paul Bonnington has been using HD within Australia, keen to try some sessions with NZ sites)
- Vladimir working on SRB.  PRAGMA meeting via Polycom bridge -  Nick: reflected on PRAGM annual report, thanks!
- MediaWiki - now going (worked with Nagthan Gardiner)
- Generic Wiki server for Canterbury - Confluence, also plan to use Shibboleth to share resources.
- : (Auckland has quite a few Confluence users, happy to share experience)

#### = Victoria=

- Kevin Buckley (Research Programmer) settled in well
- OptiPortal launched  [http://www.mcs.vuw.ac.nz/EResearch/OptIPortal](http://www.mcs.vuw.ac.nz/EResearch/OptIPortal)
- : Lots of interest from many different groups of researchers (Nick: Monash are also uses OptiPortal, see Paul Bonnington's blog)

#### = Otago=

- Vladimir visiting next week, has been retained to help setup cluster etc.

#### = Landcare=

- Delays in cluster installation (UPS and aircon).  Expect to to happen in next 10 days. Planning s/w installation.
- Major contracts upcoming: hope to use them to help support new projects quickly.
- Would like to make the cluster a formal part of BeSTGRID - to be discussed.
- Need to develop a value / business model that allows for differences in capex funding sources etc between CRIs and Universities.

#### International Collaborations

- ARCS
- MOU ready to sign.  Seems to be a simple 'intend to collaborate'
- Agreed that Nick should sign it.

- PRAGMA
- : See draft PRAGMA report, many good mentions of BeSTGRID, many thanks to Vladimir.
- : Also references to PRIME students abroad programme involving Auckland and Waikato.

### Working Groups

#### BeSTGRID Technical WG

- TODP: Membership; terms of reference; (Vladimir is the WG's current chair)
- Feedback on investment case in Federated IAM doesn't seem well understood in some organisations.
- Grid Architectures:  Small regional Grids were proposed by Stuart at Otago. Nick noted that in effect each institution has it's own grid of resources, which are integrated in a national grid.

#### ARCS Grid Ops

#### Federated IAM

- IMAGER group
- : Waiting for George to call next mtg of group.
- : Spoken to Carl, next meeting likely to be called first week of December at latest
- Neil: Carl Penwarden at MoRST.  Ready to seek advice from institutions on how to use budget allocated to IAM.  Would feed into IMAGER group at their next meeting.
- Comment: ambitious time frame, but needs be done urgently.  (We're concerned that this doesn't seem to be  making much progress)

- AAF
- : Looking for input into federated group management - "at this point Nick is just trying to get a better understanding of group management requirements and issues in a federated context, in order to evaluate what kind of role the AAF has in working towards a solution.  He's trying to find out: •	What kinds of things would you like to be able to do regarding group management? •	What’s frustrating you at the moment?"

#### trans Tasman eResearch

- Focus on outcomes from APAN BOF along with outcomes of meeting at eResearch Australasia
- : Mark and Julie taking a lead on trans Tasman training programme. To discuss with Chris Messom. Jim McGovern from ARCS taking a lead from Australia

## New Business

- Grid Middleware proposal
- : Agree specific infrastructure investments. Candidates include storage services, computation services, bringing new sites that have existing resources onto BeSTGRID, operational management frameworks, skills transfer between sites
- : MoRST keen to see a component of eResearch strategy, so can feed into medium term planning for budget '09/'10, and later.
- : Looking to prove infrastructure by further expanding science focus of BeSTGRID. Current candidates for further investment are Bioportal (expand beyond phylogenetics, integrate into VOMS etc); GeoSciences; Social Sciences. Thoughts appreciated. Need to focus on areas that we can resource from within core BeSTGRID members, given tight time frames for deliverables and critical importance of successful delivery.
- Discussion
	
- MoRST has $840k budget for this.  Now consulting withn sector on how to spend it.  Good support for BeSTGRID.  Will probably ask for Expressions of Interest in next two weeks. Looking for a sustainable Grid infrastructure, starting immediately!  How could we leverage skill/experience from BeSTGRID?
- Need to build up a long-term 'investment management' strategy
- John Hine: also some money in Capability Building fund, Panel should make a proposal to REANNZ Board for a project to use this, e.g. Make an up-to-date road map that suggests a way forward over the next few years.

[John away in Dec, Neil is Deputy Chair of the panel](http://hpc-bestgrid.auckland.ac.nz/ganglia/?m=load_one&r=month&s=descending&c=BeSTGRID+Auckland+Cluster&h=&sh=1&hc=4),]
- Seminar Series to raise awareness?  Revised road map / development strategy.  Want to identify needs within sector. Also need to "map to the objective of the funding provider"
- Robert: Canbera visit July 08: eFramework, includes geospatial. Countries involved: uk au nz nl.  Pilot project - eFramework would like to proceed. Each country needs to conribute $20k (or maybe punds). Could start by May 09, need to firm up proposal in next two weeks. Should be able to see some outcomes by end 09.  Workflows could - eventually - be used for production work.
- Robert/Neil: long-term sustainability is important - but also need to get cracking and do things!

## Action Items

- Mark and Nick will continue to work on making proposals to MoRST.
- Agreed that we should go ahead and sign ARCS MoU
- Nick will try to arrange session with Anthony Bietz

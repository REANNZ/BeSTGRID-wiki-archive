# GridTechWG-20100930

[Grid Technical Working Group](/wiki/spaces/BeSTGRID/pages/3818228403): meeting September 30, 2010.

## Program

At this TWG, I would like to go through the following:

- Review current user documentation on getting started with the grid.
- Discuss the lessons we have learnt from using the DataFabric for the earthquake response project.
- We might also coordinate poster submission for the eResearch Symposium (with the deadline being at the end of the day).

# Minutes

Attending: Vladimir Mencl, Aaron Hicks, Gene Soudlenkov, Yuriy Halytstkyy, Stuart Charters, Andrey Kharuk, Peter McGavin, Markus Binsteiner, Guy Kloss

Aaron reporting on DataFabric documentation - mostly OK, eliminating bits of Jargon.

Vlad opens a can of worms: we need a user management tool: current accounts don't collect the institution/email.

**Vlad agrees to write up** a document on the discussion outcome.

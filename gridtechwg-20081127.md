# GridTechWG-20081127

[Grid Technical Working Group](/wiki/spaces/BeSTGRID/pages/3816950451): meeting November 27, 2008.

At this meeting, Vladimir gave a demonstration of SRB - in the week before this meeting, Vladimir had just deployed an SRB server for a BeSTGRID SRB zone (located at the University of Canterbury).

The demo of what SRB allows the users to do was followed by discussion on how SRB could be made accessible to BeSTGRID users around NZ and  how other institutions could get their storage connected to the BeSTGRID SRB zone.

# Category Rocks

Articles in this category involve the [Rocks Cluster Linux](http://www.rocksclusters.org/wordpress/) distribution.

Rocks is based on [CentOS](http://www.centos.org/), which is an open source distribution of [Red Hat Enterprise Linux](http://www.redhat.com/rhel/) (RHEL). As it is derived from CentOS and RHEL the packages in Rocks are quite conservative, but some are upgraded to later versions for better cluster performance, and others are excluded from the Rocks distribution and repositories if they are overly disruptive to cluster operations.

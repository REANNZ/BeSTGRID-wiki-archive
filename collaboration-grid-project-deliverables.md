|  1.  |  We recognise that BRCSS (Social Sciences) already has Access Grid nodes set up at all the Universities. BeSTGRID will work with the BRCSS team to agree on a best-practice setup for NZ Access Grid nodes suitable for scientific and engineering applications.                                                                           |  Jul 2006  |  Aug 2006  |          |
|  2.  |  For UoA Node for Science/Eng. Specify node configuration, order hardware. (Equipment is predominantly “off the shelf” so should involve minimal shipping and delivery delay).                                                                                                                                                             |  Aug 2006  |  Oct 2006  |          |
|  3.  |  Minor building alterations at UoA Node for Science/Eng.  Provision/adaptation of furniture, cabling, equipment housing, lighting. Adjustment of air conditioning. Installation of screen material.                                                                                                                                        |  Oct 2006  |  Dec 2006  |          |
|  4.  |  Working with the BRCSS team to install additional hardware and fine tune existing nodes for BeSTGRID. Connect and test network infrastructure coupling Access GRID with Science GRID and GRID computing. Document configuration (for use by other institutions) and develop training material and instructions for use.                   |  Jan 2006  |  Feb 2006  |          |
|  5.  |  Experimental Scientific trials. Trial Access GRID  nodes between scientific communities in NZ institutions. Trial international use. Trials to include utilisations of BeSTGRID’s Science GRID and preliminary GRID Computing services.                                                                                                   |  Feb 2007  |  Mar 2007  |          |
|  6.  |  Pilot collaborative scientific projects (utilising preliminary Science GRID and GRID Computing). Training and use of facility by at least six early adopter groups in Science and Engineering. This includes the COREs associated with our institutions, together with Computer and Information Science Departments in each institution.  |  Apr 2007  |  Sep 2007  |          |
|  7.  |  Post pilot review. Evaluate the effectiveness of the Access GRID nodes (interviews/questionnaires) in Scientific applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |  Oct 2007  |  Nov 2007  |          |
|  8.  |  Production use of Access GRID coupled with Science GRID and GRID Computing services. Final report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |  Nov 2007  |  Dec 2007  |          |

# Setup NG2 at University of Canterbury

NG2 is a job submission gateway based on Globus Tookit 4.x.  At the University of Canterbury, NG2 submits jobs only to the BeSTGRID prototype cluster, while [Vladimir__Setup NG2HPC](setup-ng2hpc-at-university-of-canterbury.md) and NG2SGE allow to submit jobs to more powerful resources.  The NG2 was setup as a gateway prototype, and also works as the MIP integrator for the other gateways.

**NOTE: This page is a historic relict and is not up to date.  If you are looking for instructions on how to setup a job submission gateway for BeSTGRID, please see the ****[Setting up an NG2](setting-up-an-ng2.md)**** page instead.** |

# Preliminary setup

## Install LAM/MPI


## Install PBS client

- Installed in the same way as described in [grid](setup-grid-at-university-of-canterbury.md)

- Should have instead installed `torque-client` from APAC-Repo.

## Setup client NFS

- Shared home directories mounted from `grid`.
	
- as described in [ngcompute](setup-ngcompute-at-university-of-canterbury.md))

# APACGrid NG2 Setup

- Follow [http://www.vpac.org/twiki/bin/view/APACgrid/VmdetailsNg2](http://www.vpac.org/twiki/bin/view/APACgrid/VmdetailsNg2)
- Install basic APACGrid packages:


>  yum install Gbuild Gpulse 
>  yum install Gbuild Gpulse 

- Install PBS client
	
- APACGrid recommends `yum install Gtorque-client` (would use /usr/spool/PBS)
- I installed torque from source code with `/var/spool/torque`.  This causes some difficulties - pbs-telltail and pbs-logmaker startup scripts have to be adjusted accordingly.  Apart from that, everything runs fine - and globus reads the server logs from the directory identified by `$PBS_HOME`.

## Main NG2 Setup

- The main part of the install starts with


>  /usr/local/sbin/BuildNg2Vdt161.sh
>  /usr/local/sbin/BuildNg2Vdt161.sh

- Precisely, I did not run the script but instead executed it step-by-step on the command-line.


>  **The only real difference is that I do not have a*GUMS** server yet, and I would have to comment the PRIMA initialization out of the script.
>  **The only real difference is that I do not have a*GUMS** server yet, and I would have to comment the PRIMA initialization out of the script.

- In the end, there were several steps I had to do manually to start the container:


- The extra /etc/sudoers lines are necessary.  The build script installs a slightly different configuration (for use with *PRIMA*), and the when Gridmap is used (my setting until I install a GUMS server), the command given to sudo is slightly different and must be explicitly permitted.
- I have also created four user accounts for VOMS mapping.  My current system configuration has NFS shared homes among `grid` (server), `ngcompute`, and `ng2`.  Password files are however separate - so a user must be created on all these three machines.

> 1. on grid, ngcompute, and ng2:
>  adduser -u 95005 grid-admin 
>  adduser -u 95006 grid-user
>  adduser -u 95007 grid-bio
>  adduser -u 95008 grid-bestgrid
>  adduser -u 95039 grid-startup
>  adduser -u 95040 grid-cloud

> 1. on just one (create .globus directory and scratch directory within that)
>  for I in grid-admin grid-user grid-bio grid-bestgrid grid-startup grid-cloud ; do 
>    mkdir -p /home/$I/.globus/scratch 
>    chown -R $I.$I /home/$I/.globus 
>  done

## PBS logs

- `yum install pbs-telltail`
	
- may report error:

``` 
Starting pbs-logmaker Can't access directory: /usr/spool/PBS/server_logs [FAILED]
```
- The error may be ignored - it is necessary to edit `/etc/rc.d/init.d/pbs-logmaker` and change the pbs-logmaker argument to the actual `PBS_HOME` directory.
- Continue with


>   chkconfig pbs-logmaker on
>   service pbs-logmaker start
>   chkconfig pbs-logmaker on
>   service pbs-logmaker start

On your cluster headnode (`ngcompute` here), also install `pbs-telltail`, and copy `/usr/local/pbs-telltail/pbs-telltail.RH` to `/etc/rc.d/init.d/pbs-telltail` (edit the PBS_HOME directory in the file as needed).  Then:

> 1. on ngcompute
>   chkconfig pbs-logmaker off
>   service pbs-logmaker stop
>   chkconfig pbs-telltail on
>   service pbs-telltail start

## PBS.pm

- `yum install Ggateway`
- Copy `/usr/local/src/pbs.pm.APAC` to `/opt/vdt/globus/lib/perl/Globus/GRAM/JobManager/pbs.pm`
- I did the following modifications:

## Audit capability

- Just run `/usr/local/sbin/AddAuditNg2Vdt161.sh`
	
- modifies `/opt/vdt/globus/etc/gram-service/jndi-config.xml` with connection parameters to audit database
- adds Audit logger configuration to `/opt/vdt/globus/container-log4j.properties`
- `/etc/cron.hourly/auditquery` (installed with `Ggateway`) emails Job-DN mappings to GOC
	
- Sample email:

``` 

From: root <root@ng2.canterbury.ac.nz>
Subject: ng2.canterbury.ac.nz JobID 20070515
To: grid_pulse@vpac.org

Job-DN: 276.ngcompute.canterbury.ac.nz /C=AU/O=APACGrid/O=BeSTGRID/OU=University of Canterbury/CN=Vladimir Mencl

```

**Important**: In addition, you have to make sure your cluster is [reporting the job statistics](setup-ngcompute-at-university-of-canterbury.md) to GOC.

## Configuring PRIMA

**Note**: in March 2008, I have [installed a GUMS server](setup-nggums-at-university-of-canterbury.md) and switched the gateways to use PRIMA.  Due to the [whitespace issue](setup-nggums-at-university-of-canterbury.md), I had to install an updated PRIMA library properly encoding and decoding the whitespace.  I have used the one I compiled when helping to solve the problem, and which was installed on the VDT161 instance on Ng2SGE.

After doing that, it was sufficient to turn PRIMA on with:

>  /opt/vdt/vdt/setup/configure_prima_gt4 --enable --gums-server nggums.canterbury.ac.nz

## Future recommendations

- To configure PRIMA to use a GUMS server (once I have it), the command will be


>  /opt/vdt/vdt/setup/configure_prima_gt4 --enable --gums-server $Gums_Server
>  /opt/vdt/vdt/setup/configure_prima_gt4 --enable --gums-server $Gums_Server

- On any future installs, double check that `GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE` is set to `40000-41000` (in `/opt/vdt/post-setup/APAC01.sh`)
	
- Globus otherwise uses arbitrary listener ports for credential delegation service instances.  This may conflict with a firewall either at your site, or with a client connection firewall at other sites.
- All new users must have their `/.globus/scratch`<sub> directory created.  Globus automatically creates </sub>`/.globus`, but not the scratch directory (`${GLOBUS_SCRATCH_DIR`})

## Comments

- The original pbs.pm file did not work for me.  Pbs.pm created a job script file that:
	
1. treated the job as multijob (not job type specified)
2. tried to ssh the command to the nodes listed in `$PBS_NODEFILE`
3. the ssh command sequence had an additional command to store the exit code in a file
4. the script tried to read the value from that file
5. ssh command failed (`Host key verification failed.`).
		
- `ng2` (short hostname) is not in `/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts` on `ng2`
- Anyway, `ngcompute` does not have host authentication set up to ssh onto itself.
6. In the end, the script failed: it read an empty value from the exit-code file, and caused a bash syntax error:

``` 
/var/spool/torque/mom_priv/jobs/204.ngcompu.SC: line 53: [: too many arguments
```
7. This issue could be (probably) solved by allowing ssh host authentication from `ng2` to `ng2`
8. Not relevant anymore: using APAC pbs.pm

- An observation about PBS:
	
- qstat reports all jobs only locally
- remotely, qstat reports only jobs owned by the current user

- Note: Ggateway also installs

# MDS / MIP setup

The MDS setup needs some preparatory reading.  Good starting pages are [http://www.vpac.org/twiki/bin/view/APACgrid/UsingMDSFour](http://www.vpac.org/twiki/bin/view/APACgrid/UsingMDSFour) and [http://www.vpac.org/twiki/bin/view/APACgrid/PlanResource](http://www.vpac.org/twiki/bin/view/APACgrid/PlanResource).  The installation procedure is described at [http://www.vpac.org/twiki/bin/view/APACgrid/MdsVMDeployment](http://www.vpac.org/twiki/bin/view/APACgrid/MdsVMDeployment).  It worked for me to just follow the procedure, but you really should now what you are doing.  Read first.

## Secure your MDS

Depending on when you installed your gateway, you may have to run an extra script from the Gbuild package to secure your MDS.  On `ng2`, run

>  yum update Gbuild
>  /usr/local/sbin/SecureMdsVdt161.sh

The script:

- creates `$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus_wsrf_mds_index/client-security-config.xml` (use containercert)
- modifies `$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus_wsrf_mds_index/upstream.xml` (use above client-security-config)
- creates empty `/etc/grid-security/mds-grid-mapfile`
- replaces `$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus_wsrf_mds_index/index-security-config.xml` (require mds-grid-mapfile authorization for non-read-only methods)
- modifies `$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus_wsrf_mds_index/server-config.wsdd` (add reference to index-security-config)

This script ties your MDS down so that only authorized hosts (those that have a mapping in `/etc/grid-security/mds-grid-mapfile`) can publish to the local MDS.  This is necessary, because your compromised MDS would also compromise the upstream central server.  

However, this script itself also breaks internal registration of the RFT service and the GRAM jobmanager.  The viewpoint of APACGrid is that this is not planned but welcome casualty.  It is not needed for current APACGrid operations.  For new services deployed, the GLUE schema data format is preferred.  Gerson however approved to publish the information into the repository now.

This is how I re-enabled the service registration on my machine. In `/opt/vdt/globus/etc/`

1. copy globus_wsrf_mds_index/client-security-config.xml to gram-service/client-security-config.xml and to globus_wsrf_rft/client-security-config.xml
2. edit globus_wsrf_rft/registration.xml and add 

``` 
<SecurityDescriptorFile>etc/globus_wsrf_rft/client-security-config.xml</SecurityDescriptorFile>
```

 past RefreshIntervalSecs
3. similarly, edit gram-service/registration.xml and add 

``` 
<SecurityDescriptorFile>etc/gram-service/client-security-config.xml</SecurityDescriptorFile>
```

 past RefreshIntervalSecs
4. add the mapping for local host into /etc/grid-security/mds-grid-mapfile 

``` 
"/C=AU/O=APACGrid/O=BeSTGRID/OU=University of Canterbury/CN=host/ng2.canterbury.ac.nz" grid-mds
```

 in my case
5. service globus-ws stop; service globus-ws start

## Installing MIP

- Setup JCU yum repo 

``` 
wget -P /etc/yum.repos.d/ http://ng0.hpc.jcu.edu.au/apac/gateway/rpms/jcu-apac.repo
```
- Install MIP 

``` 
yum install APAC-mip-module-py APAC-mip-globus
```

## Configure local MIP data

The configuration is described at [http://www.vpac.org/twiki/bin/view/APACgrid/ConfigureAPACInfoServiceProvider](http://www.vpac.org/twiki/bin/view/APACgrid/ConfigureAPACInfoServiceProvider) (and the instructions below are borrowed from there 🙂 ).

- Run `/usr/local/mip/mip` and you should get about 10 lines of statically configured information.
- Edit `/usr/local/mip/config/apac_config.py`
	
- use your queue name in `computeElement.Name = 'queue_name'`
- check the paths for
		
- `computeElement.qstat = '/usr/bin/qstat'`
- `computeElement.pbsnodes = '/usr/bin/pbsnodes'`
- Turn on the reporting for the cluster and computing elements
	
- edit /usr/local/mip/config/default.pl, and uncomment the lines
		
- `Cluster => `["cluster1",], and
- `ComputingElement => `["compute1",]

## Enable the JobManager field

The JobManager field will be particularly important on the LoadLeveler-integrated [NG2HPC](setup-ng2hpc-at-university-of-canterbury.md).

To publish the JobManager field in MDS, it's not enough to set the field in `/usr/local/mip/config/apac_config.py`:

``` 
computeElement.JobManager = 'PBS'
```

It is also necessary to change `/usr/local/mip/modules/apac_py/ComputingElement/computingelement.py` to output this field (patch below).

TODO: check what other fields are not published by APAC MIP

## Configure provided Software information

You also need to configure information about software installed.  This is in detail described at [http://www.vpac.org/twiki/bin/view/APACgrid/ConfigureAPACSoftwareInfoProvider](http://www.vpac.org/twiki/bin/view/APACgrid/ConfigureAPACSoftwareInfoProvider).  One option mentioned there is feeding the information from the [APAC Software Map](http://nf.apac.edu.au/facilities/software/).  However, our sites are of course not registered there, so this option is not readily available.  The contact person for the software map is [Ben Evans](http://anusf.anu.edu.au/~bje900/), however, I have not yet succeeded to establish contact with him.  Temporarily, a usable solution is to configure the software list locally in an XML file.

The Softare Information Provider (SIP) configuration file in `$MIP/config`, the of the file name is `cluster``_``subcluster``_SIP.ini`.  For me, the name of the file should be `ngcompute_sub1ngcompute_SIP.ini`... but actually, MIP requires it to be called `default_sub1ngcompute_SIP.ini`.  Reason uknown, resolved with a symlink 🙁

This configuration file specifies the URI for the software information source.  For a file-based source, I'm using

>  uri: file:softwareInfoData/ngcompute-localSoftware.xml

To create the file, copy `/usr/local/mip/modules/apac_py/SubCluster/softwareInfoData/localSoftware.xml` to `ngcompute-localSoftware.xml` in the same directory.  The important part of my contents is:

``` 

<SoftwarePackages ...>
        <SoftwarePackage LocalID="MrBayes/3.1.2" xmlns="http://grid.apac.edu.au/glueschema/Spec/V12/R1">

Now validate your data with

>  /usr/local/mip/config/globus/mip-exec.sh -validate

## Turn MIP on

If MIP is configured correctly on your system and `mip-exec.sh` produces valid information, it is the time to integrate MIP into globus.  A rough outline of this procedure is at [http://wiki.arcs.org.au/bin/view/Main/IntegrateGridAusInfoServiceProvider](http://wiki.arcs.org.au/bin/view/Main/IntegrateGridAusInfoServiceProvider).  A detailed description of how to do the integration manually is at [http://wiki.arcs.org.au/bin/view/Main/ManualMIPGlobusIntegration](http://wiki.arcs.org.au/bin/view/Main/ManualMIPGlobusIntegration).  Luckily, the last mentioned page is not needed anymore, and the integration is done simply with the comamnd

>  /usr/local/mip/config/globus/install -l /opt/vdt/globus

I recommend studying this command first to see what is changed - it patches the files `downstream.xml`, `upstream.xml`, `server-config.wsdd`, and `hierarchy.xml` in `$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus_wsrf_mds_index`, and installs `mip-exec` as a information provider into globus.

After running the `install` command, edit `$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus_wsrf_mds_index/hierarchy.xml` and make sure you specify the correct primary MDS server (the install script incorrectly specifies `ng2.sapac.edu.au` instead of `mds.sapac.edu.au`) and preferably also the backup MDS server (`ngmds.hpcu.uq.edu.au`).  The `upstream` entries in the `config` element should be 

>     [https://mds.sapac.edu.au:8443/wsrf/services/DefaultIndexService](https://mds.sapac.edu.au:8443/wsrf/services/DefaultIndexService)
>     [https://ngmds.hpcu.uq.edu.au:8443/wsrf/services/DefaultIndexService](https://ngmds.hpcu.uq.edu.au:8443/wsrf/services/DefaultIndexService)

And restart the globus WS container in order for all the changes to take effect

>  service globus-ws stop; service globus-ws start

## Checking MDS contents

If everything works fine, you should see your site now listed at [http://www.sapac.edu.au/webmds/webmds?info=indexinfo&xsl=apacgluexsl](http://www.sapac.edu.au/webmds/webmds?info=indexinfo&xsl=apacgluexsl)

You can also query your own MDS service

>  wsrf-query -s [https://ng2:8443/wsrf/services/DefaultIndexService](https://ng2:8443/wsrf/services/DefaultIndexService)

query the service at Canterbury

>  wsrf-query -s [https://ng2.canterbury.ac.nz:8443/wsrf/services/DefaultIndexService](https://ng2.canterbury.ac.nz:8443/wsrf/services/DefaultIndexService)

or see the dump of all sites in the central APAC MDS server

>  wsrf-query -s [https://mds.sapac.edu.au:8443/wsrf/services/DefaultIndexService](https://mds.sapac.edu.au:8443/wsrf/services/DefaultIndexService) "//*[local-name()='Site']"

or see just a single site as its contained in APAC MDS server

>  wsrf-query -s [https://mds.sapac.edu.au:8443/wsrf/services/DefaultIndexService](https://mds.sapac.edu.au:8443/wsrf/services/DefaultIndexService) "//*[local-name]"

Note that in order for the wsrf-query command to work, certain jars with Java XML binding for the GLUE types must be installed - these come with the MDS server.  Thus, this command should work on your `ng2` machine (but may not work on the client `grid` machine).

# Additional Modifications

- [PBS job tagging](pbs-job-tagging.md) to make distinguished name and email address of the user submitting the job available to PBS.
- [Fixing startup order](vladimirs-grid-notes.md#Vladimir&#39;sgridnotes-Fixingstartuporder) to avoid problems when Globus RFT starts before MySQL.

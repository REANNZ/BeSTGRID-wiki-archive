# WorkShop__Geoscience collaboration and GEON Auckland


## Schedule

To set the scene the first day of the workshop elicits high level discussion involving scientists and cyberinfrastructure developers from the USA, New Zealand and Australia, targeted at opening up knowledge of opportunities and improving collaboration within a broad range of e-science initiatives. Then the GEON-related workshop sessions will be covered during the next 2 days. There will be time for more individual interactions with each other and the GEON team during or after the meeting also.

The workshop is scheduled to take place on the following dates:

- November, 2007

26th: [Driving Research Collaboration in Geoscience](#WorkShop__GeosciencecollaborationandGEONAuckland-DrivingResearchCollaborationinGeoscience)

27th: [GEON Workshop day 1](#WorkShop__GeosciencecollaborationandGEONAuckland-GEONWorkshop)

28th: [GEON Workshop day 2](#WorkShop__GeosciencecollaborationandGEONAuckland-GEONWorkshop)

# Driving Research Collaboration in Geoscience

The workshop will include a day of high level discussions involving scientists and cyberinfrastructure developers from the USA, New Zealand and Australia, targeted at improving collaboration within a broad range of e-science initiatives.

Topics to be covered include:

- Geoscience collaboration within New Zealand
- Geoscience colllaboration between New Zealand and Australia
- Geoscience collaboration from Oceania to the world

There is some great work going on in many places, and we can obtain some useful synergies (and after all, this is really the aim of cyberinfrastructures such as GEON: to enable better collaborative science). 

### Program


# GEON Workshop

This workshop will appeal to domain scientists interested in e-science and cyberinfrastructure, as well as computer and information scientists who have research interests in cyberinfrastructure and grid computing.  Topics will include a detailed look at the workings of a cyberinfrastructure (based around the Geosciences Network: www.geongrid.org ), examples of science projects that take advantage of this infrastructure, and descriptions of approaches to data sharing and interoperation (including semantic mediation) that allow scientists to share data more effectively.

### Presenters

**[Dogan Seber](http://atlas.geo.cornell.edu/people/seber/research.html)** ("[Enabling Discoveries in the Earth Sciences Through the Geosciences Network (GEON)](http://sdsugeology.blogspot.com/2007/02/seminar-dogan-seber.html)") and **[Mark Gahegan](http://www.geog.psu.edu/people/gahegan/)** ([College of IST, PSU](http://ist.psu.edu/ist/directory/faculty/?EmployeeID=72)) are working to put together a good balance of geoscience and computer science for the workshop, and are planning to include geoscientists active within the GEON community within the visiting group.

### Topics

Here is a list of quite general topics that the GEON team can cover at the workshop, and that seem appropriate to our emerging needs:

1. CyberInfrastructure (CI) ethos of collaboration, general aims and example projects from different communities
2. GRID technologies, CI middleware & data services
3. The GEON portal and user-level tools & services
4. GEON applications and science projects, including: fossil & climate database, Lidar tools and visualization technologies
5. Data integration tools & web mapping services, ontologies for mediation, knowledge-level computing, cyber-communities

### Participants

It is intended that participation in the workshop is as open and representative as possible, although the current location being used at Auckland has a maximum limit of 25 to 30. Every effort will be made to provide room for all confirmed attendees, however in the unfortunate case where registrations become closed please accept our apologies. We hope to attract New Zealand and Australian geoscientists to the workshop.

### Costs

There are no costs for attendance at this workshop.

### Catering

Registration includes morning and afternoon refreshments, and light food and refreshments over each lunch break.

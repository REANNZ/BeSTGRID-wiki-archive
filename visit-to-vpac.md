# Visit to VPAC

The main outcome of that visit that Andrey has been given status [Registration Authority Operator (RAO)](http://www.vpac.org/twiki/bin/view/APACgrid/RaoDescriptor) of APAC [Certificate Authority](http://www.vpac.org/twiki/bin/view/APACgrid/CertAuthority). That allows to make requests to issue APAC CA certificates. This privilege can also extend to Vladimir Mencl and the Massey programmer in due course.

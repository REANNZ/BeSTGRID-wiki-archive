### BeSTGRID Community

#### Outreach

- Mark Gahegan presented at MoRST Chatshop. Very successful: expressions of support from senior people at MoRST (Wynn, George) for BeSTGRID; keen to support trans-Tasman sessions at APAN and eResearch Australasia, and to see funding bids coming through RIAG process.
- Neil Gemmell, Mark Gahegan presented at VUW eResearch symposium
- APAN 26
	
- Telemedicine organisation continuing, with several video conferences and discussions ongoing.
- Julie Watson (REANNZ) has supplied Nick with list of APAN contacts. BeSTGRID people to use local influence to ensure that trans-Tasman session is well-attended and a success.

#### Funding

- More than $100K still available in KAREN CBF Travel and Events.
- MoRST $4.2M: not yet clear what the timing and procedures for this will be, but more details should be available soon.

#### Institutional Reports

- Auckland:
	
- Monthly Exec Committee meetings scheduled for remainder of the year. Taking a discovery oriented approach to learning of institutional needs and opportunities, to inform the development of a more directional strategy by end of year
- Meeting with existing cluster operator in our Stats department next week, to discuss approaches to sharing knowledge and providing integration mechanisms (grid, meta scheduling) across resources. Some background on the Stats environment is here: [http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~kimihia/sun-grid](http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~kimihia/sun-grid)
- Continuing to work with researchers in several groups (bio, social statistics, CFD, ...) to assist porting code to the grid. Alot of analysis and education involved in upskilling researchers into computational complex approaches. Threading, distribution, batching, non interactive execution, scripting for parameter sweeps, etc. All unusual and difficult conceptually and technically to grasp for many researchers who've previously had minimal exposure to complex programming.
- Work on SASS and metascheduling. Raising licensing issues.
- Massey:
	
- Massey BeSTGRID Gateway
		
- currently renewing host certificate
- otherwise working again
- Anton's Grid-Ireland trip
		
- 2 weeks working with Grid-Ireland group at Trinity College Dublin; similarities in terms of budget and institutional user base.
- also visited grid group at University College Cork
- preparing a full report which will be made available to KAREN and BeSTGRID
- also available to do presentations on Grid-Ireland by request: agreed that BeSTGRID session via Access Grid would be good thing to organise.
- Key information brought back from trip
			
- how to address current lack of MPI job submission
- operational/organisational lessons from Grid-Ireland's experience
- how to reduce management and create a consistent gateway deployment with Quattor and simplify grid deployment at new sites
- how to increase KAREN throughput by upgrading the grid and changing organisational focus
- an update on current eLearning research
- collaboration with Kiwi@Home and volunteer computing projects
- Marine Grid
- graphical (graph-based) job submission and Webcom-G
- advertising eResearch in NZ to experts in Ireland
- Collaborating with Grid-Ireland on volunteer computing projects
		
- BOINC multiple operating system worker programmes
- server deployment
- Spring Grid Computing School
		
- Some delays due to time clashes for key people involved; now likely to be spring.
- Canterbury:
	
- Vlad is due back next week. Has been fact-finding at Czech Grid: request a report back on findings.
- Victoria:
	
- VUW E-Research Symposium on 11 June. More than 60 attendees from VUW and Wellington-based CRIs. Report available at [http://www.mcs.vuw.ac.nz/EResearch/Symposium](http://www.mcs.vuw.ac.nz/EResearch/Symposium). Mostly good feedback - Mark and Neil's presentations went down really well.
- Launched at the symposium: E-Research Professional Development Awards. Making available 3 x $3000 to provide for up to 50% of costs of researcher attending an international e-research conference (will help them apply to KAREN Travel Fund for other 50%).
- VUW is partner in KAREN CBF project led by GeoNet (GNS lead is Paul Grimwood, also involved in SCENZ-GRID with Robert Gibb et al.). Contracts and sub-contracts are still being sorted out but planning is underway in the meantime.
- E-Research Strategy (developed by John and Sam) has been endorsed by Vic's IT Strategic Oversight Committee and by the Research Committee: doc available at [http://www.mcs.vuw.ac.nz/twiki/pub/EResearch/Resources/vuw_eresearch_strategy.pdf](http://www.mcs.vuw.ac.nz/twiki/pub/EResearch/Resources/vuw_eresearch_strategy.pdf). Next step is development of an internal funding proposal for establishment of a research computing service / e-research support service.
- ESR Institutional Capability project organiser seeking help organising an Access Grid session late July with ESR staff attending at Auckland, Vic, Canterbury. Sam has spoken with Nick and will also get in touch with Canterbury. ESR may not be making most of the opportunity to get together with university researchers at the same time - will see if this can be incorporated, esp. given that there are already existing collaborations.
- E-Research Programmer has been recruited and will be starting in August. (Pending his acceptance...)
- Hoping to get at least one programmer and one bio researcher grid certificates during July, and to get a couple of staff certified as RAOs if VPAC staff are at APAN (otherwise maybe at E-Research Australasia later in the year).
- Starting conversations about getting BG gateway up and running (hoping ITS may provide capex) and getting SundGridEngine-managed unix machines and Condor-managed student lab PCs under Globus in near future.
- Sam is leaving VUW at the end of July: she thanks everyone for advice and support and welcomes opportunity to stay involved.
- Otago
	
- Vlad is going to Otago at some point to help out on a contract basis, and will supply some grid certificates to end users while there.
- Mike Harte (ITS, eRAG) keen to get someone in ITS certified as an RAO - could be tied with eResearch Australasia as an awareness raising opportunity.
- Tim working on Condor grid; new genomics server. Uptake on services has been good, but this is now causing strain on current systems.
- Music School investing in digital studio that will be KAREN-enabled.
- Landcare
	
- SCENZ-GRID portal is in its first iteration; users can register and log-in though there are some firewall issues outside UoA to be sorted. SCENZ-GRID is seeking feedback; strategy for community involvement will evolve over time.

#### International Collaborations

- ARCS:
	
- Nick venturing to Melbourne in several weeks to speak with Tony Williams; things on verge of becoming more finalised.
- PRAGMA:
	
- Neil Gemmell and Paul Bonnington were leading this previously. Vladimir attended PRAGMA in Taiwan: a report back would be useful.

### Working Groups

#### Technical

- All agreed that a technical working group is required. Should involve initial BeSTGRID staff - Andrey, Yuri, Anton, Vladimir - as well as interested parties from other institution. (e.g. Tim Molteno and Stewart Stevens at Otago; Mark Davies, Andrew Mellanby and new e-research programmer at Vic.)
- At this stage, does not need to be formal, but will need a chair and a structure at some point in future.

#### Federated IAM

- Nothing to report.

#### Trans Tasman eResearch

- Requires effort in getting people to APAN to participate.

## New Business

- Licensing issues for tools such as SASS and MATLAB are being dealt with locally; need for some information sharing and possible development of common approach.
- BeSTGRID tools being used locally; less cross-institution work taking place.
- Emerging theme of data storage: may be a way to broaden disciplinary service base for BeSTGRID services? Some work to be done on evaluation SRB and IRODS in this context.

## Action Items

- Encourage staff at institutions to attend APAN. (All)
- Ask Vlad to report back on PRAGMA Taiwan and visit to Czech national grid organisation. (Robin)
- Begin establishing a technical working group. (Nick)
- Staff certification at Otago and Victoria. (Mik, John, Vlad)
- Continue work on formalising ARCS relationship. (Nick)
- Circulate information about MoRST/CBF funding as it becomes available. (John, Jenni)

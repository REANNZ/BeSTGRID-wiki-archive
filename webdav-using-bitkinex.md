# WebDAV using BitKinex

This site contains instructions on how to install BitKinex on Windows and connect to the BeSTGRID datafabric.

BitKinex is a WebDAV client that supports large files and has good performance.

Walkthrough:

*To anonymously access the Christchurch Earthquake Data __skip*_ authentication and jump to installation and use `df.bestgrid.org/BeSTGRID/home/NZDF/CHCHEarthquake220211` as your server address._

**First, we need to do the authentication part:**

If your institution is not member of our shibboleth federation, you might need to apply for an account at the ARCS IdP (applicable esp. for earthquake response people). Go to:

[https://idp.arcs.org.au/idp_reg/](https://idp.arcs.org.au/idp_reg/)

Create an account and tell us or drop us an email (m.binsteiner@auckland.ac.nz) so we can fast-track your account approval.

Remeber the username and password, you'll need it in the next step.

Start Grix (a java webstart application â€“ you need to have java installed):

- click: [http://ngportal.canterbury.ac.nz/grid/grix-jdk5-bestgrid.jnlp](http://ngportal.canterbury.ac.nz/grid/grix-jdk5-bestgrid.jnlp)
- Select "Authentication" tab
- Select "Institution login" tab
- Select your institution (or "ARCS IdP" if you have applied for an account there)
- Enter your institution (or "ARCS IdP") username
- Enter your institution (or "ARCS IdP") password
- Click the Authenticate button, this will create a local proxy certificate.

- Click the Upload button and pick a username and password of your liking (your username might already be taken, also, the application checks whether the password is reasonably secure so you might need to add a digit or two...). This will upload the certificate to MyProxy. Remeber this myproxy username and password because you'll need it in the next part.

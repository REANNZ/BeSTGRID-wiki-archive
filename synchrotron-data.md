# Synchrotron Data

There are a variety of groups from around New Zealand working with the New Zealand beamline on the [Australian Synchrotron](http://www.synchrotron.vic.gov.au/). The details of this collaboration are covered in the [Australian and New Zealand Synchrotron-based Science Strategic Plan](http://www.synchrotron.vic.gov.au/content.asp?Document_ID=4805).

The background to the New Zealand Government decision to co-invest in the Synchrotron as key science infrastructure is outlined on the MoRST website "[New Zealandâ€™s Investment in the Australian Synchrotron](http://www.morst.govt.nz/current-work/science-infrastructure/synchrotron/)". The New Zealand investor is the [New Zealand Synchrotron Group Limited](http://www.synchrotron.rsnz.org/); a company formed by Auckland, Massey, Waikato, Victoria, Lincoln, Canterbury and Otago universities, Crop and Food Limited, AgResearch Limited GNS Science Limited, and Industrial Research Limited.

# GridTechWG-20110526

[Grid Technical Working Group](/wiki/spaces/BeSTGRID/pages/3816950451): meeting May 26th, 2011.

## Program

- Discussing Markus's proposal for an Authentication and Authorization solution for BeSTGRID/NeSI services.

Markus has written this up at

[https://wiki.auckland.ac.nz/display/BeSTGRID/Authentication+and+Authorization+setup](https://wiki.auckland.ac.nz/display/BeSTGRID/Authentication+and+Authorization+setup) 

## Minutes

Attending: Vladimir Mencl, Stuart Charters, Markus Binsteiner, Gene Soudlenkov, Andrey Kharuk, Aaron Hicks, Kevin Buckley

- Markus presenting his vision

- an identity service, collecting privileges associated with identities (authorization), and being assosicated with a number of external identities (authentication) - Shibboleth, X509, Gmail + OpenID

- Vlad asking: do we enable this service as an Identity Provider?
	
- Markus: possibly
- Vlad: arguing why not (conforming to federation rules, being trustworthy enough)
- Markus, Aaron: only for a subset of the identities, conforming to stricter rules

- Overall motion: good idea, need to develop further, especially use cases.  Markus will elaborate on the wiki page

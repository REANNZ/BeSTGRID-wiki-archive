# General notes on Otago gateway

The Otago gateway has been setup to connect multiple clusters in the Department of Physics at the University of Otago to the Australia/New Zealand grid, ARCS/BeSTGRID.  The gateway system runs a number of virtual machines, one as the job submission gateway for each cluster, and a few additional ones for general purpose tasks (such as `grid` for client command-line tools).

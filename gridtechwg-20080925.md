# GridTechWG-20080925

[Grid Technical Working Group](/wiki/spaces/BeSTGRID/pages/3818228403): meeting September 25, 2008.

This was the second meeting of the group.

Vladimir gave a demonstration of the Shibboleth enabled Grix, and what the user experience in getting Shibboleth enabled certificates is.

The discussion then focused on getting other BeSTGRID institutions integrated into the Shibboleth infrastructure.

Tim Molteno has taken the following notes (edited by Vladimir):

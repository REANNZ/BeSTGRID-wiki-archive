# Overview

- EVO is a videoconferencing application implemented in Java - so everyone will need Java installed on their computer.  That should be included in a standard UoC Windows install.

- EVO runs on Windows, Mac and Linux

- EVO needs direct access to the internet (UDP packets).  On the University of Canterbury campus, this requires running the Internet Enabler.

- For proper videoconferencing experience, I would recommend for everyone to use a webcam ($60) and a headset (headphones + microphone).

When using just plain PC speakers and a microphone built into the webcam or into the computer monitor, there's a big risk of creating echo and ruining the meeting - everyone ***else*** speaking would hear an echo of what they say - but the person causing it would be just unaware there's anything wrong.

# Getting started

The main page for EVO is [http://evo.vrvs.org/](http://evo.vrvs.org/)

- First create an account via the Register link
	
- pick a username and password
- wait for an email with a confirmation code
- check your SPAM filter if the email is not coming
- the account will only work after entering the confirmation code

- After creating the account & entering the confirmation code, start EVO by clicking the Start link.  That points to a Java WebStart (JNLP) file, which should be passed to Java - which should in turn download and start EVO.
	
- When prompted, login with the just created username and password.

# Searching for meetings

In EVO, users can belong to multiple *communities* - and each meeting is located in a particular community.  In NZ, register into the KAREN community - and if you have Australian collaborators, also into the ARCS-AARNET community.

- Use the Search Communities command in the Search menu.
- Both KAREN and ARCS-AARNET are listed under "National Education and Research Networks".

# Creating meetings

To have an impromptu meeting with another user:

- Locate the user under the right community in the bottom left corner.
- Right-click the user and either Start a chat (text-mode), Invite the user to a meeting (video+audio), or Add the user to your buddie list

- The organizer should book a meeting beforehand (or create it on the sport) by choosing either "Book a Meeting" or "Start and Ad Hoc Meeting" from the Meetings menu.

# Joining meetings

Just click the meeting in the meeting list in the right community.  You may be prompted for a password of the organizer selected one.  You should have been communicated that password in the meeting invite - but if stuck, just open a Chat with the organizer and ask to be Invited (within EVO) into the meeting.

When joining a meeting, turn on your microphone and the camera if not already on.  The microphone is controlled from the main EVO window, while the camera is controlled by the camera icon in the Video EVO (ViEVO) window.

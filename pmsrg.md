; Project Description:

The Plant Molecular Science Research Group comprises members of the School with primary research interests in molecular aspects of plant science. Current interests of members of the group focus on the following topics: the molecular function of genes involved in flowering control; the structure, function, biosynthesis and evolution of plant cell walls; wine yeast genetics; magnesium transporters and aluminium tolerance; hormone signalling, regulation of cytokinesis and molecular plant taxonomy and biogeography. 

Karine's group is investigating the early events of auxin signalling. Auxin is one of the major plant hormone implicated in virtually every aspect of plant growth and development. Despite its established biological and agronomic importance, the molecular mechanisms underlying the auxin early response remain unclear.

Karine is particularly interested in the auxin extracellular receptor ABP1 (Auxin-binding protein 1), an essential membrane-bound protein that control early events in auxin signalling.

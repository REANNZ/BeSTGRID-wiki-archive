# Data Storage at the University of Auckland

- 40 terabytes (33 TB Raided) IBM Fibre Channel Serial ATA (Network Attached Storage)
- Delivered end - Nov 2006
- Shared scientific data dumps from Public Sources (GenBank, NCBI, Biomirror, Climate Physics)
- Secured-shared internal research data from large experiments
- ftp site mirroring large public ftp sites (for sourceforge, AARNET-ftp etc) for provision to KAREN members (only) (for research related tools etc)
- Internal UoA medium term storage for near-line data from research activities (available as desktop filesystem as well as through portals)

## Usage

- The storage is now available for housing Research Data
- [Research Projects using the BeSTGRID Data GRID](research-projects-using-the-bestgrid-data-grid.md)
- It is currently available as smb (SAMBA) network storage internally to the University of Auckland. Hence, it can be made available to any Mac, Linux or Windows PC Desktop
- We can also provide access via NFS to select servers in the University
- Other services (such as rsync) are also available
- If you are using the storage as smb, all usage (i.e. through rsync) should adhere to the [SAMBA usage restrictions](/wiki/spaces/BeSTGRID/pages/3818228430)
- Soon, it will be part of the national BeSTGRID Data GRID (i.e. globus GRID ftp, SRB etc)

Following the good work of Vladmir Mencl and the University of Canterbury BeSTGRID team from last month, the University of Auckland has now got a fully operational computational grid gateway. This gateway that can be used to transparently connect computational resources at the institution to those throughout New Zealand and Australia. Building on the work of the Australian National GRID and the Victorian Partnership for for Advanced computing, and within New Zealand with the BeSTGRID project, programmer Andrey Kharuk successfully installed the first gateway which now registers University of Auckland resources on the APAC grid operations centre and associated tools. Well done Andrey!

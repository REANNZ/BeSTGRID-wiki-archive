; Project Description:

DING proteins are a family of proteins with the characteristic DINGGG- N-terminus. They have been isolated from species of all kingdoms and the proposed biological functions of the various members differ greatly. DING proteins may have roles in some of the most prevalent human diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, kidney stone disease, atherosclerosis, cancer and HIV.

Our lab is currently working on the structure-function relationship of DING proteins from various Pseudomonas species. Work on eukaryotic DING isolates may provide potential therapies for a number of human diseases such as breast cancer. Genetic identification of eukaryotic DING genes is also a priority as this may allow early diagnosis of the noted diseases.

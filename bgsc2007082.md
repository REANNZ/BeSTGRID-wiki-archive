***Administration***
- Review [action items from previous SC meeting](/wiki/spaces/BeSTGRID/pages/3816950759#Bgsc200708.1-ActionItems)
- Q4 TEC Report
	
- TEC report submitted. Paul requested comments. No feedback from the SC members present.
- Subcontracts for final 6 months
	
- Final agreement received from TEC, signed 22nd August 2007.
- Paul circulated subcontract proposal ~6 weeks ago, which will now be put in place. Auckland RO to contact other instutions in next few days.
- Paul notes that end date of contract is May 2008, while funding for FTEs ends at the end of Feb 2008. The additional time is for reporting and feedback.
- TEC Encouraging Innovation Fund
	
- $16mm 2008 fund, $18mm subsequent years, OPEX only
- Proposing submission includes
		
1. extending BeSTGRID to other NZ institutions
2. Proposal includes 1 FTE at each participating institution
3. addition of training workshops etc
4. John Hine is supportive, and is happy for VUW to take lead on making proposal
5. Budget suggested is $700k - $1m, which won't cover 1 FTE at each institution. Therefore should existing BeSTGRID institutions be on this application
6. need to specify deliverables/focus, which could include AAF and institutional identiy, gateway setup and support, grid connectivity, etc
- Paul requested comment
		
- Chris Messom - in terms of all institutions being involved, sees this as essential to maintain continuity, to exploit existing capability. Without this creates a high level of risk
- Chris Messom raised the issue of the Leadership role - we would need to examine leadership role and requirements carefully before handing off to another institution. Robin supports this strongly - need to keep the core group together.
- Vladimir - stretch and capacity issues. Don't see that current capacity could be extended to support other institutions. Still large amount of work to be done that are site specific, such as data grid, making the grid user friendly, etc. Doesn't think there will be a point in time where this work will reduce, as this is predicated by funding for support of specific projects, of which there are a large number (BeSTGRID only supports 1 prime project currenlty - the BioPortal).
- Paul has received responses from all instutitions, all of whom want to be a part of a subsequent proposal.
- Gerrit - Video Conferencing as an example
			
- All institutions need to be in Phase in terms of maturity and capability
- BeSTGRID develops this technology, productionises, and moves onto other early stage technologies
- Therefore role for BeSTGRID needs to run across all institutions
- Nick Jones raised point that if funding priority shifts to diffusion of capability, this could undermine BeSTGRIDs ability to continue to be the early adopter of technologies
- Chris Messom suggested that in parallel the need to start sponsoring a VPAC model for NZ, which Paul endorsed.
- Two proposals suggested to support the 2 streams - exploration/discovery and diffusion of mature capability
			
- Robin suggested perhaps 1 bid with sub projects, while keeping an umbrella project
- Paul raised concerns that sub projects would be candidates for cutting, hence might not be an effective mechanism
- Agreement that Paul will continue conversation with all parties. Submission due end of October 2007.

***Progress Reports***
**Massey**
- Compute GRID
	
- Globus:
		
- All domain names and externally resolvable IP addresses allocated.
- Contact with David Bannon (VPAC) stalled, Anton visit delayed to Sept/ Oct
			
- Vladimir suggested technical team attend APAC sessions on Monday @ 5pm on AG
- BestGRID SGI Cluster
		
- SGI cluster delivered and assembled components, currently commissioning
- UPS upgrade to be complete in 2 weeks
- Internal users on stream by end August, external ssh users by mid September
- BeSTGRID@HOME
		
- Setup a BOINC server skeleton in a Virtual Machine.
- Obtained Domain Name for BOINC Project.
- Investigating genome assembly software for KiwiGenome@HOME project
- Storage GRID
	
- Lustre file system installed and tested
- 4 Gbps raw disk IO performance on single SAN, striping over all SANs with lustre file system approx 8Gbps
- Collaborative GRID
	
- Remote Teaching
		
- Prolog Programming paper to be recorded and delivered using EVO and Mediasite
- Comparative evaluation of technologies
- Paul congratulated Anton on bringing Massey onto APAC GOC, good symbolic milestone.

**Canterbury**
- Vadimir
	
- Setup of additional gateway is finished, which is front end to computational grid at Canterbury. This is now a real computation grid available using MDS.
- Paul asked if BeSTGRID members can start testing - Vladimir is comfortable from a technical perspective. Robin is happy for people to play
- Vladimir away next week, going to MAMS AAF workshop. Paul requested Vladimir enquire about Sakai shibbing activity at MAMS.
- New server coming close to delivery for unicast bridge for AG

**Auckland**
- Data
	
- NZ Social Sciences data archive is now live at Auckland at [http://ssdash.auckland.ac.nz](http://ssdash.auckland.ac.nz). This will be skinned to fit within BeSTGRID. Paul acknowledged that it's great to see a success within the social sciences
- Have allocated 25TB of storage, which is coming close to limit. Are investigating how to grow this.
- Collaboration
	
- Migrating current collaboration applications to new ITS funded gateway "Pleyads"
- Looking at deploying AAF integrated applications in mid to late Sept
- Auckland is now level 2 AAF identity provider
- Computation
	
- BioEngineering cluster connectivity is in planning stage, should be online within next month
- Administration
	
- Draft internal UoA report on eResearch is being circulated. It is clear that UoA ITS will continue to support Auckland provided services independent of other funding mechanisms.

***New Business***
- Digital Strategies Summit 2.0 - November. Sessions on KAREN. Any desire for a BeSTGRID presence? Suggest SC members review programme.
- Nevil off to APAN on late Saturday night.
- Gerrit and Paul are both going to Allhands in UK in 10th September

***Action Items***
- John Hine to continue leading development of bid to TEC "Encouraging and Supporting Innovation" fund

# BeSTGRID and KAREN

The Kiwi Advanced Research and Education Network (KAREN) connects all the NZ Universities and CRIs, all of the BeSTGRID resource providers are connected to the KAREN network.

You can confirm a particular site is accessible via KAREN using the KAREN Tester at the University of Otago [http://www.otago.ac.nz/its/networkphones/karen.php](http://www.otago.ac.nz/its/networkphones/karen.php)

This can be particularly useful to determine if an overseas research partner is accessible via the KAREN international connectivity.

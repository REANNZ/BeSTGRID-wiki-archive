# GridTechWG-20101104

[Grid Technical Working Group](/wiki/spaces/BeSTGRID/pages/3818228403): meeting November 4, 2010.

## Program

We've all had a busy time last week at the eResearch Symposium, so the

TWG got postponed by a week.

At the last TWG, we were discussing the need to have a user management service where the users would register for BeSTGRID services - incl. the computational grid and the DataFabric.  The service would be web-based (no extra tools needed) and would be based on a Shibboleth (AAF/Tuakiri) login - making it easier to get started with BeSTGRID services.

I have written up the outcome of the last discussion at [https://wiki.auckland.ac.nz/display/BeSTGRID/User+Management](https://wiki.auckland.ac.nz/display/BeSTGRID/User+Management) and Markus and Nick have been contributing to this document further on.

This document will be the starting point - and the TWG will be aiming to clearly specify the requirements for a BeSTGRID user management service.

Markus has already written up use cases for the User Management services at

[https://wiki.auckland.ac.nz/display/BeSTGRID/User+Management+Usecases](https://wiki.auckland.ac.nz/display/BeSTGRID/User+Management+Usecases)

Please consider that as additional input for tomorrow's meeting.

; Project Description:

Dr Hautus (University of Auckland) and Dr Johnson (Macquarie University) are collaborating on a project to elucidate some of the brain mechanisms underlying the separation and assignment of auditory stimuli to auditory objects; sometime referred to as auditory scene analysis. This requires the collection of electrophysiological data (EEG, fMRI, and MEG) which needs to be accessed by the teams working at Auckland and Macquarie.

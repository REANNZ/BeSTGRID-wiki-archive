# Driving Research Collaboration in Geoscience

This workshop will be a day of high level discussions involving scientists and cyberinfrastructure developers from the USA, New Zealand and Australia, targeted at improving collaboration within a broad range of e-science initiatives.

Topics to be covered include:

- Geoscience collaboration within New Zealand
- Geoscience colllaboration between New Zealand and Australia
- Geoscience collaboration from Oceania to the world

There is some great work going on in many places, and we can obtain some useful synergies (and after all, this is really the aim of cyberinfrastructures such as GEON: to enable better collaborative science). 

### Draft Program

Please feel free to suggest additions or deletions of topics you would like to see covered.

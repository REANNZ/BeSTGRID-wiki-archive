# GridTechWG-20100826

[Grid Technical Working Group](/wiki/spaces/BeSTGRID/pages/3818228403): meeting August 26, 2010.

## Program

At tomorrow's TWG, I would like to go through the following:

- Plan deployment of pooled accounts over all of BeSTGRID sites

- Look at existing gateways and for those that have a problem, see why they are not showing up in Grisu
	
- Critical to deploy MDS primer at all sites! (VUW, Otago/Maggie, and Massey have all needed a poke)

- Plan the workshops and presentations for the eResearch Symposium.

# Minutes

Attending: Kevin Buckley, Andrey Kharuk, Vladimir Mencl, Guy Kloss, Yuriy Halytskyy, Gene Soudlenkov, Peter McGavin, Nick Jones, Aaron Hicks

- Vlad asking Kevin why MDS primer not running
	
- The MDS primer script must be querying the local NG2, not the central index
- Vlad to send a detailed email with instructions.

- Vlad describing pooled account proposal
	
- Kevin concerned about users using the grid for storing data, particularly if they keep being mapped to the same account.
- Nick concerned about user experience (extra registration)

- Kevin asking about grid account auto-provisioning and DataFabric-grid links

- Yuriy concerned about migrating existing files into individual accounts

- Nick proposes to create a data storage policy - first step.

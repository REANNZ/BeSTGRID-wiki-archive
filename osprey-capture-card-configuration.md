# Osprey Capture Card Configuration

To provide a compatibility between Osprey Capture Card and AG3.1 that might be needed to set (in the Osprey VidControl, under Capture Properties) the Default Output Size to 352x288 (with Auto Size off). 

Screens shots and and more detailed description will be provided later.

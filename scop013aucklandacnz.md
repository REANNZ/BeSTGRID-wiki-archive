Hello!

I'm [Stephen Cope](http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/showperson?firstname=Stephen&surname=Cope) from the [Department of Statistics](http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/), University of Auckland.

I "look after" the Sun Grid Engine used by the Department of Statistics.

Current challenges: figuring out how to [submit a job using Globus](/wiki/spaces/BeSTGRID/pages/3818228623).

; Project Description:

Research at the Laboratory of Structural Biology focuses on the central importance of three-dimensional structure in biology. Our multidisciplinary approach to biological questions includes research in structural genomics, structure-based drug design, protein engineering, and structure determination by X-ray crystallography and NMR.

The laboratory forms a central part of the [Maurice Wilkins](http://www.mauricewilkinscentre.org/) Centre of Molecular Biodiscovery, one of seven New Zealand national Centres of Research Excellence

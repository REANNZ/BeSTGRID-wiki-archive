## Progress Reports

### Massey

- BestGRID BOINC
	
- BOINC server up
- BOINC development environment compiled across multiple platforms
- Test Application available: [http://kiwi.massey.ac.nz/testapp](http://kiwi.massey.ac.nz/testapp)
		
- windows (32bit) and linux i386
- BestGRID Condor
	
- Mock lab under test nodes installed
- BestGRID Gateway under repair: back next week
	
- NJ: This does raise broader issues around how to go from pilot to production services. CM: Virtual machine approach should make this easy once hardware is in place.

### Canterbury

- Shibboleth Service and Identity Provider Metadata shifted into the MAMS meta data management system
	
- all SPs and IDPs now receive meta data updates automatically from MAMS
- Assisting Otago with setting up gateway infrastructure for Physics.
- Polishing BeSTGRID federation IAM.
- Setting up copy of Shibbolised Mediawiki for Nathan Gardiner for AVCC.
- FRST bids: Virtual Institute of Statistical Genetics need assistance with storage. Agreed that this could be covered by existing TBs of BeSTGRID storage at Canterbury. Neil to advise them.
- Congratulations to Neil G: off to Otago from 1 May 2008.
- Interest in Sakai, but would be easier if it were Shibbolised. NJ: Technical work completed however Auckland team member moved on to new role, and no current plans to roll out as not a BeSTGRID TEC deliverable. Contributions to move this forward welcomed.

### Auckland

- Order placed with SGI for BeSTGRID Auckland Cluster
	
- Running internal informational session 13th February with SGI
- OBIS data provisioned
- BLAST data provisioned
- UoA programmer working on IAM (esp. Shib) has moved onto another job: recruiting replacement now and have made sure that knowledge was captured on wiki before he left.
- Discussion around inclusion of BLAST in Geneious in non-certificated ways: NJ to make case to BioMatters for inclusion of restrictions via certificate now rather than later as it will be more difficult at a later date. Relates to AAF discussions about introducing complexity for researchers. Should be able to piggyback on existing security for other tools e.g. MrBayes.

## New Business

- Several students from Waikato Bioinformatics coming to Auckland to receive certificates to access BioGrid
- Discussions with Waikato about getting their cluster integrated with BeSTGRID: Vlad would estimate ~2 weeks for this (same as Otago).
- IAM: Discussions around BeSTGRID IdP - currently self-authenticating, but is that enough? Need to move forwards; cannot be relying one each organisation to have its own IdP up and running soon. SCIT is committed to AAF, so in principle no problem to us BeSTGRID at Level 1 and to piggyback on AAF IdP for Level 2. Need to look for policy and strategy alignment with Min of Ed, but not rely on them for implementation guidance or support. Also needs for wider discussions, e.g. CONZUL. Neil's IAM report will not be released publicly but overview will be available.
- No update on TEC ISI application; should be February sometime.
- No update on KAREN CBF applications; Advisory Panel meet 12 Feb, then recommendations go to Board, so likely March response.
- KAREN Institutional Capability Fund applications due mid-March. Not competitive so would be good to share ideas.

## Action Items

- Nick to draft a response to BioMatters re security restrictions via certificates for BLAST in Geneious. Will send round for SC feedback.
- Neil to advise Scion (Phil Wilcox?) of offer of BeSTGRID storage assistance for Virtual Institute of Statistical Genetics.
- All to circulate KAREN Institutional Capability Investment Plan suggestions as appropriate.
- Noted previous offer from Gerrit from [December (Final) 2007](/wiki/spaces/BeSTGRID/pages/3818228562) meeting, to discuss a subscription to EVO with SCIT.

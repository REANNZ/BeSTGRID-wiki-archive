; Project Description:

Bio-Mirror is a public bioinformatics service in New Zealand for high-speed access to up-to-date DNA & protein biological sequence databanks. In genome research, these databanks have been being growing tremendously, so much that distribution of them is hampered by existing Internet speeds. The Bio-Mirror project is devoted to facilitate timely access to important large data sets for this research. High speed access is provided by Internet2 infrastructure of the Very High Speed Backbone Service (vBNS), Abilene, TransPAC, the Australian Academic Research Network (AARNet) and the Asia-Pacific Advanced Network (APAN).

Using Standalone [BeSTGRID BLAST Server](/wiki/spaces/BeSTGRID/pages/3818228594) for high-speed search of GenBank (a database of protein sequences).

- Firewall mostly opened to allow GRID services

Present and Future GRID software 

- Arranging Monitoring and discovery tools for APAC
- Installing MrBayes (+additional software) to expose to APAC

GRID and eScience Summer School (KAREN event support Fund)

- $8K approved for summer school ($25K applied for)

### Canterbury 

- Vladimir away, Neil busy, so progress has been a little slow
- hardware in place, successfully installed VMs, Globus, Job Submission, GUI operational, at end of May
- BioMatters (Tobias) - GirdSphere portal for Bio Informatics, based on JCU portal. Tobias thoroughly rewritten and documented. This portal is MDS connected, so could be much more broadly applied outside Bio Informatics, with the inclusion of additional portals.

- Then start to look at external usage
- Staging from test to production installation on gateway.
- Second gateway setup to connect to P575
- Suggest need to discuss other software packages as long hanging fruit e.g. Nimrod (parametric analysis) supported by VPAC

**Auckland **
- Bio Engineering collab node fully operational. Running collab sessions with Oxford in next few days
- Sakai VRE, emails are fully supported now
- Production Shib'd mediawiki going live
- New EVO page on Wiki
- UoA eResearch taskforce, report due in next month
- Cluster Budget - intention was to have a sandpit environment. Now having discussions with BI group, with intention for it to sit alongside other BeSTGRID institutional clusters

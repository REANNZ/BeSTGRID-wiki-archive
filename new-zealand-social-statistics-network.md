# New Zealand Social Statistics Network

## [New Zealand Social Statistics Network](http://www.nzssn.org.nz)

The New Zealand Social Statistics Network (NZSSN) was recently established

(November 2004) to assist in the development of quantitative social science

research in the academic, government and private research sectors. The

intent of the network is to provide a focus for both sharing research

development resources and improving the accessibility of quantitative

research data.

NZSSN's intent and activities are based on those of the Australian

Consortium of Social and Political Research Incorporated (ACSPRI).

NZSSN's activities include research methods courses, seminar series,

workshops and hosting international visitors in association with national

and international colleagues. NZSSN hosted a week-long short course on using

mixed methods in research and program evaluation in 2005, and followed up

with a 2006 summer programme, including 5 short courses (check out the

details and course evaluations). The 2007 equivalent took place in February,

with three short courses taught in Wellington.

In addition, NZSSN has held a large number of seminars in advanced

quantitative methods, and workshops on event history modelling and social

simulation (both microsimulation and agent-based).

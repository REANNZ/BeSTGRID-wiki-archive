- Description

The aims of the project are to explore a theoretical model for secondary mathematics teacher knowledge, develop parallel research programmes, share classroom data, and move into joint work including papers or grant applications.

It is planned to form two small groups (n≤6), one at each site, to meet using video-links and tablet technology. We intend to meet monthly via video-conference for about one hour. We will share documents, diagrams, discussion, and will record our conferencing.

We will also set up a website on which we can share data—in particular video data of classrooms. These websites will be secure (the video data is not public domain). They will also have a message board, links to participants’ web-pages, and to articles we write or wish to use.

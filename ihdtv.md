# IHDTV

(the UW system) Requires 1.5 Gb/s (that is, a 10G link end-

to-end)

Lowest latency (1/3 sec plus speed of light), looks super,

needs decode hardware NZ end, would be 2-way HDTV, probably better

resolution (1920x1080i) than the projector you'll have there. Could use

Skype for backchannel.  Would also require UW to provide tech support and

hardware on the NZ side.

# SLCS

Short Lived Certificate Service (SLCS) allows users to get a grid certificate using their institutional credentials.

The certificates have a short life (typically 24 hours) compared with X509 Grid Certificates (that typically last for a year).

Instructions on how to get a SLCS certificate and how to use it can be found [here](using-slcs-certificates-at-university-of-canterbury.md)

# Framing comments

Sam:

- Jenni and I were able to have a quick chat after our SC meeting and she has provided some valuable information that may help us to frame a response:
- **The first version of the strategy did not mention research at all! Jenni and others at MoRST have worked*very** hard to even get research into this document. E-research has been inserted/deleted any number of times, so the fact that it has made it into the consultation document is very positive.
	
- Eighteen Ministries (many of them far bigger than MoRST!) are considered stakeholders in the Digital Strategy: all are looking to push their own agendas on behalf of their own communities.
- In this context it is unlikely that the quantity of material on research is likely to increase, so we need to be concise. In making our points, we need to keep in mind the genre and level of the document (national policy statement - very high level!) and the appropriate level of language that we need to use - we need to avoid jargon, and make our points clearly in language that can be easily understood by non-experts.

Nick:

- Thanks for this background Sam, it has been clear that Jenni and her MoRST colleagues have done an exception job in raising awareness to this level. It really is encumbent on "us" to now ensure that this hard one positioning is best utilised.

Nick:

- All of our contributions likely need to be refinements of what already exists, specifically referenced to a particular paragraph/sentence.
- The eResearch call out box would seem to be the section within which we have the most scope for contribution, given our legitimacy in representing this community. I'd suggest we need to convey in a much grander sense the trajectories of change that are driving other countries to invest heavily in eResearch. My suggestion would be something along the following lines:
	
- Research is becoming systemic and multi-scale, and globally distributed. This is pushing the development of the leading edge of telecommunications networks, large scale data management, collaboration tools and platforms, and computation.
- Each research discipline has specific technology requirements, set by consensus with their international peers as such research is conducted inside globally coordinated collegial communities. This means the technical barriers to participation are high, based on the capabilities in these emerging and rapidly evolving technologies.
- Developing infrastructure and capabilities to enable our researchers to participate in these collegial communities is critical to our ability to be global leaders in science and research.

# How we need to provide feedback

Sam:

- There is a preferred format for submissions: see the online form at: [http://www.digitalstrategy.govt.nz/digital-strategy-2/Have-your-say/submissionform/](http://www.digitalstrategy.govt.nz/digital-strategy-2/Have-your-say/submissionform/) (a downloadable version of this is also available, which might be easier for us if we are trying to work on this collectively). This asks specific questions about each goal, and provides a section at the end for respondents to blow their own trumpet about how they will be contributing to NZ's digital future.
- Can we agree to provide feedback using this form? If so, then I suggest we structure our meeting discussion next week around the various sections of the form.

## Channels

Nick: I see our aims in providing submissions as fitting into two distinct modes:

1. To gain the support of various stakeholder groups/agencies/ministries who will digest and reassemble all the feedback
2. To speak to the wider public community engaged in this discussion.

The potential to win mindshare through being smart about submission mechanisms should not be overlooked. Feeding comments into the channels as we reach consensus before the submission date will allow others to engage with us in a conversation. This will be more effective than holding back and putting everything in at the end.

I suggest we submit the same content via all available channels, as each channel will have it's own readership - some people wiki, some people don't - which will provide us with the most exposure in order to solicit as much input and discussion as possible. The below channels could all be considered for appropriate types of contributions:

- Digital Strategy web site
	
- comments under each section
- Digital Strategy Wiki
	
- refinements to text
- comments
- Formal submissions
	
- BeSTGRID
- CONZUL - Janet Copsey has raised their support of our submission as a possibility
- LIAC - Janet Copsey has raised their support of our submission as a possibility
- Institutional submissions

# General comments

- Sam: Productivity is a theme (e.g. 2.2, p.14): can we tie this to e-research?
- Sam: Focus on 'content' and copyright not as helpful in e-research space as for others.
- Nick: No mention of Research into ICT either. I know many of the faculty are concerned this isn't a consideration. Is it too late to push this barrow?
- John: We tried to push this with DS1, both the research and what was then the start of dropping enrolments.  I don't think anyone took any notice.  However this is relevant in terms of the gap between broadband bandwidth and new services â€“ see more below.
- Nick: Research infrastructure investments, such as KAREN, Genomics Consortium, HPC bid, Backbone Funding for Nationally Significant Databases, all have components of eResearch, which can act as an organising strategic perspective/view. Perhaps including these initiatives in the Actions under each section will ensure that we're highlighting the current activity as much as the gaps. Perhaps a little more paletteable. Also will help to build recognition through association.
- Neil: Not surprisingly I see no acknowledgment that the current government investment in the whole digital strategy is small in comparison to  Australia's investments. I would like to see acknowledgment that more needs to be spent on capability build and on infrastructure development.

# Specific comments: 1. Introduction

- 1.2 Progress since 2005
	
- p.8, mentions KAREN
- p.10, mentions, New Zealand Digital Content
		
- omits mention of Nationally Significant databases
- P.11, mentions skills shortages as a barrier

# Specific comments: 2. The new digital environment

- John: We don't really want to get into an argument with the authors over this but 1989 is a poor choice for the date on which the web was created.  It appears to be an answer from Wikipedia.  TBL says he had the concept in 1989 but the first browser and servers were 1991. If we are going to use the concept then I would refer one to Ted Nelson's Xanadu project (ca 1980) and even back to Licklider's "Libraries of the Future" in 1965.

# Specific comments: 3. The enablers: connection

## 3.2 Connection Priorities and Challenges

- John: I wonder if we should push for "investor in R+D" to be added to the government's roles in second para of 3.2?
- Sam: International connections are noted at bottom of p.17 as an infrastructure gap. [But are not translated into any obvious actions in 3.3?](https://reannz.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=BeSTGRID&title=But%20are%20not%20translated%20into%20any%20obvious%20actions%20in%203.3%3F&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=3816950456)

3.2 also has a boxed section on "eResearch in New Zealand" on p.18.

Nick: placement of this section seems a little at odds. This section is around telecommunications infrastructure. The eResearch manifesto is one of "Collaboration", hence this section should be located there?

- John: Placement is odd, but if this section survives somewhere I would like to see "creation of new technologies" become something like "creation and adoption of new technologies, developed in NZ and elsewhere."
- Sam: I agree: placement is odd. Moving the break-out box to section 6.5 under Collaboration makes sense - 6.5 mentions tools and middleware as well, so is probably more appropriate for the changes John suggests.

- Sam:
- **I am not sure that the definition of eResearch here (second paragraph in the box) and elsewhere really encapsulates what we are on about. I am quite taken at the moment with this one, being used to promote the eResearch Australasia conference:*eResearch focuses on technological platforms that enhance researchers' ability to generate, collect, share, analyse, store and retrieve information.** One of the things that I like about this definition is the active verbs - it makes it sound a bit more exciting!
	
- I think this misses several important things from what is there at the moment: a) that the services are web-based b) that they required advanced networks like KAREN c) real-time aspects and d) we are talking about data as well as information and knowledge (this is different from the rest of the strategy's focus on 'information') and e) collaboration, but these are covered off reasonably well in the following paragraph.
- description of virtual research environments as "'virtual spaces' created by information technology tools or systems" could be simplified to "shared online workspaces with tools and services that support collaborative research".
		
- Nick: VRE as a term is a of limited value. The Science Gateways concept seems to provide an intuitive sense of the scale of these platforms. [Agree that VRE is overly jargony, but I disagree about 'Science Gateways' as a replacement as VREs are one of the few tools that can be used across most, if not all, research disciplines.](https://reannz.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=Sam&title=Agree%20that%20VRE%20is%20overly%20jargony%2C%20but%20I%20disagree%20about%20%27Science%20Gateways%27%20as%20a%20replacement%20as%20VREs%20are%20one%20of%20the%20few%20tools%20that%20can%20be%20used%20across%20most%2C%20if%20not%20all%2C%20research%20disciplines.)
- the definition of grid computing seems a bit wonky but I can't think of anything better to replace it with at the moment!
		
- Nick: agreed, am thinking on this one.
- Chris: "grid computing - infrastruture to support easy use of geographically dispersed computers and supercomputers", is better. It will be very difficult getting a geographically dispersed set of computers to function as a true "supercomputer" with the latencies and bandwidth on something like KAREN.
- Neil: I agree with above discussion. I note the statement 'KARENâ€™s main role is to enable research and support tools'. I agree with this in the research context but KAREN, in my view, is much broader than just support for eResearch.

## 3.3 Connection actions

- Sam: "Accelerating broadband investment" and "progressing competition in the telecommunications sector" are very broad: does this cover upgrades to international connections that would make a difference to us?
- Neil: BeSTGRID is probably not the forum for my particular concerns here. I believe the strategy is too conservative in regard to basic infrastructure. I am in agreement with the thrust of the New Zealand Institute's plan to get the basic infrastructure - read fibre - out of the short-term profit market. NZ needs open-access fibre that can then used as the basis for market players to mount services for customers.  The TSO should be thrown out, not tinkered with, and a more direct mechanism (government tenders?) developed to serve remote users. I would also like to see some rationalisation of government initiatives - KAREN, all of government, Health, education â€“ surely we can work more effectively together.

# Specific comments: 4. The enablers: confidence

- John: This is a powerful section.  Tertiary education reform is only one nine actions!  Should we write something about preparing NZ for a paradigm shift in how we do things and how big a task that will be?  Maybe they have thought of this and judged it to scary for many readers.

## 4.1 The new goal

- Sam: The three groups they have identified - managers, ICT specialists, and users - map quite nicely onto the e-research space.

## 4.2 Capability priorities and challenges

Sam:

- It is hard to disagree with the list of priorities and challenges here. It is good to see skill shortages addressed as an issue. However, overall, the idea of "confidence" being promoted here is at quite a low level for the types of skills needed to build e-research capability.


>  **Also, is there a risk though that in addressing these shortages, the focus becomes ICT-only when what is needed is interdisciplinarity? The e-research workforce needs people that combine domain knowledge*and** advanced ICT skills. Building up the workforce of Java programmers and web developers may not help us that much if they are not also able to bring scientific or scholarly knowledge / understanding to the table.
>  **Also, is there a risk though that in addressing these shortages, the focus becomes ICT-only when what is needed is interdisciplinarity?

Building up the workforce of Java programmers and web developers may not help us that much if they are not also able to bring scientific or scholarly knowledge / understanding to the table.

- John's point above is a good one: we have some experience in trying to get people to do things differently. Can we offer something by way of advice here?

## 4.3 Capability Actions

- Sam: These all look good, with disclaimers that a) what e-research needs is a bit more high-level than this and b) ICT skills ideally need to be combined with other skills/knowledge relevant to research if we as a community are to benefit.

## 4.4 Security Priority and Challenges

- Sam: Security in the Strategy seems to be all about locks, not about keys! There is no sense here that access control (as opposed to "security") is an enabler for sharing resources. Is there space to highlight IAM/AAF type activities here?
- Neil: I agree that it would be good to have the 'enabling' aspect of security through access control highlighted in some way. Federated access done effectively can certainly be a major enabler in both research and teaching & learning activites.

# Specific comments: 5. The enablers: content

- Sam: This whole section of the strategy largely reiterates the Digital Content Strategy, which was virtually silent about issues around datasets (except for government geospatial data and statistics). The only thing in the content strategy and here that appears to be directly relevant is the New Zealand Scientific and Research Programme of Action, led by MoRST with baseline funding. Anyone heard of this or know what it is supposed to achieve?

## 5.1 The new goal

- Sam: Breakout box on p.27, The complexities of applying the Digital Content Framework to research data need to be addressed. Though the framework itself is useful, there is no sense of scale of resources required here - we could usefully point to the establishment of ANDS over the Tasman (at a costs of $26M!).

## 5.2 Digital Culture

- Sam: NZ content is aligned here with "culture" and the "creative sector" in a very narrow way : NZ also has unique scientific/natural heritage that is not reflected here.

## 5.3 Digital Culture Actions

- Sam: Nothing here really addresses the big issues around long-term management of research data. Can we sugggest any concrete actions in this area, e.g. a National Research Data Strategy?

## 5.4 Digital business priorities and challenges

- John: Section 5.4 talks about increasing the use of worldclass productivity tools.  For some reason e-Research is seen as a niche here.  Maybe we can draw on our experience to point out that adopting complex tools is a complex task.  This will take investment and time.

- Sam: Focus on open access to publicly-funded research is commendable. But where are the actions and funding streams to build the infrastructure, awareness and cultural change in the research sector to make this real? This section mentions MoRST's NZ Scientific and Research Programme of Action again, but I don't know how well we are engaged with that. What MoRST can achieve within baseline funding in this area is also an issue.

# Specific comments: 6. The enablers: collaboration

- Sam: We should make a point of saying that we are happy to see Collaboration added to v.2.0. It is also nice to see that researchers are included here!

## 6.5 Researchers

Sam: 

- This section is all woolly as anything. The Strategy "ackowledges needs", "supports the development and exploitation of eresearch", and notes that "new digital tools and middleware will support access to knowledge and enable economic transformation". But sadly this is not backed up by any actions. I wonder if this is an appropriate place to talk about the Advanced Network Capability Building Roadmap?
- Actually this whole section doesn't have any actions, and unlike Connection, Confidence and Content, Collaboration doesn't even have a goal! It seems like the strategy is saying that Collaboration is the means by whichthe other three things will happen. And yet, as we know, digital collaboration is a goal and outcome in itself, and actually relies on the other three (or at least Connection and Confidence) to happen in the first place. So I am a bit confused about the role of Collaboration in the strategy overall. [the diagram in 7.1 just makes me even more confused in this regard\!](https://reannz.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=Note&title=the%20diagram%20in%207.1%20just%20makes%20me%20even%20more%20confused%20in%20this%20regard%5C%21) This seems to me to be just reinforcing the myth that collaboration will "just happen" and we are all too aware that this is not the case.
- Neil: Perhaps this section offers the opportunity to talk about a further capability build funding, relating it to the Road Map?

## 6.6 The Overarching Sector Forum

This section proposed a governance or advisory group to facilitate collaboration and asks for feedback: "In particular, what would you like to see the forum focus its work programme on?"

- Sam: I am not sure what I think about this idea, but assuming that it will go ahead anyway, we could suggest that representation on the national council could be provided by MoRST, NZVCC (Research and SCIT), Science NZ, the KAREN Capability Building Advisory Panel, and CONZUL.
- Neil: I support this initiative. It is too hard to ensure the Digital Strategy will move forwarded evenly without some group charged with this responsibility. It will have the effect of keeping the Strategy alive.

# Specific comments: 7. Achieving our digital potential

## 7.1 What will it take?

- John: 7.1 refers to "A mindset change" so someone is thinking of a paradigm shift.

- John: The figure at the bottom of pg 41 is probably the best place to discuss my concerns.  The enablers are broadband (raw bandwidth), capable and confident users and content creation.  What is completely ignored is the volume of complex software (middleware and applications) that will need to function on top of the broadband if we are going to achieve the more ambitious goals, particularly collaboration.  Certainly greater bandwidth to more users will increase the percentage of the population able to watch youTube, but that is not the real goal.  We will need people who are able to install and administer (and in some cases develop) complex software to achieve the goals.  The report does not address this in any significant way.

- Sam: I agree with John about this diagram being a pertinent point for discussion, and would emphasise that at the moment collaboration isn't even perceived as a goal or outcome in its own right.

## 7.2 Productivity: Achieving a creative, knowledge-based, high-income economy

- Sam: Productivity and innovation are bundled together here - is this useful? Innovation / R&D are reduced to 'digital exports'. The IDC Market Research noted here (or the way it has been reported) again makes it sound like broadband itself boosts GDP! Surely we need some tools and people to help with that too ðŸ™‚

## 7.3 Community: Enriching and valuing NZ communities and cultures, and promoting our unique national identity

- Sam: See earlier point about "heritage" - people's identities are informed by their natural environment and scientific heritage, as well as by broadcasting, libraries and museums. Maybe we could highlight the "Kiwi Bird Genome" project to demonstrate this point?

## 7.4 Sustainability: Using advanced technology to achieve sustainable growth as a nation

- Sam: What do they mean by "sustainability"? Videoconferencing is used here as an example of a "smart technology" that can contribute to sustainable growth, yet we know that the sustainability of technologies like videoconferencing is a constant battle! (National booking system, anyone?) It seems that technologies contribute to sustainability, but the sustainability of the technologies themselves is not perceived as an issue.
- Neil: Picking up on the 'national booking system' issue I believe there is a major problem harking back to the 1990's when development of infrastructure was not considered necessary - it would just happen as a byproduct of development in general. This view still seems to hold currency with many, hence the low level of support for infrastructure development and the necessary central coordination of some activities. Most countries have a variety of central agencies that can be called upon to provide central coordination of activities where it is seen as advantageous - NZ has few it seems. No one has put there hand up to support the necessary coordination regarding video conferencing, despite significant efforts to find an appropriate and willing body.

## 7.5 Rising to the challenges

### Have your say: On achieving our digital potential

**Using digital technology, what contribution will you make to improving our productivity (achieving a creative, knowledge-based, high-income economy)?**

- Nick: This is a great section to place aspirations around eResearch. International collaborations leading to retention of leading edge research talent in NZ; integration of NZ with international research driven evidence based development of best practice in industry, government, etc; ....

**Using digital technology, what contribution will you make to enriching and valuing New Zealand's  communities and cultures, and promoting our unique national identity?**

- Nick: Referring to nationally significant or unique datasets which ensure NZ is represented adequately and accurately in international research programmes.

**Using digital technology, what contribution will you make to achieving sustainable growth as a nation?**

- Nick: Monitoring of evironments (physical, organisational, systemic, biological) over time, towards creating sustainable historically referenced perspectives on such like.

**What contribution do you think others need to make to achieve our digital potential?**

- ?

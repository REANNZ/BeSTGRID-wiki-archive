with BeSTGRID SC members, discuss implications
- Fund oversubscribed x 3 of available funding
- Notification around February/March 2008, disbursements starting May 2008. Sam Searle to follow up.
- BeSTGRID completes in February, so gap in funding continuity.
- BeSTGRID Project Management component inside TEC ESI proposal critical
***MoRST ChatShop and Meeting with MoE about Fed IAM***
- Programme for Friday 26 Oct
- Attendees
- Key Messages
- Gap between ESI TEC proposal and shared/core/common infrastructure funded within 3 institutions within BeSTGRID
- Reference to other internation e-Science/e-Research strategies and programmes
- Can't let this develop in silo's, need a national strategy and programme
- Paul to circulate slides for MoRST discussion to SC members
- Looking to discover the reality behind the MoE programme and progress
- Other geographies have this funded centrally but devolve the work and related capability develpoment back into the sector
***AAF Participation***
- Several BeSTGRID SC members attended Grid Working Group session at APAC 07
- Considered extremely useful.
- Paul congratulated Vladimir on his contributions and engagement in the discussions.
- Overall focus is on removing the certificate management overhead from grid service provisioning. Vladimir tracking this work closely.
- KAREN CBF funded AAF roadshow is being run by Neil James and James Dalziel. Both Vladimir and Eric are attending each of these sessions to share their experiences and establish relationships with other institutions.
- Workshops being held November Monday 5th Auckland and Tuesday 6th Canterbury
- Vladimir and Eric presenting on experiences in setting up AAF infrastructure in NZ at both workshops
***APAC07***
- Further comments
- David Bannon keen to pick up on the BioPortal work
- Vladimir has prepared a task list for improvements for the BioPortal. Neil is willing to hire Tobias to complete some additional work, up to 1 month.
- Anton won a best paper award. Congratulations from BeSTGRID SC.
- Paul reflected a general sense that NZ community is very engaged and respected
- Nick reflected that other parties from outside Australia were very impressed with their approach, level of coordination, etc.
***BeSTGRID Continuity Planning***
- BeSTGRID Director's role
- Paul noted he has resigned effective 7th Jan 2008, to start at Monash 8th Jan 2008.
- Paul putting in place continuity plan for e-Research capability at UoA, incorporating current roles and people.
- Discussion needed on how BeSTGRID Directorship should continue through to end of funding in February 2008, and for production of the final report by May 2008.
- UoA VCSDF available $150k, for project management and directors positions
- Robin proposed that Nick take a lead on pulling together the final report if funding/support available
- Chris has suggested that Massey / Canterbury have capability to step up in support, however as Auckland are the contracted lead party, it is seen as inappropriate that other institutions take a formal leadership position
- Paul suggested that where he sees the most valuable contribution coming from Neil and Chris is in the national outreach role such as the MoRST chatshop
- Highlighting and promoting the BeSTGRID concept to the funding and policy groups
- Chris agreed that this is desireable
- Robin has suggested widening the responsibility at a national level
- John Hine, Sam Searle, Rob Ballagh, Mik Black, Robert Gibb, Mike Udstrom - include TEO's, CRI's, Mox
- This is distinct from the KAREN Capability Build Panel
- Gerrit suggests both an informal approach initially, but with an explicit aim to formalise and make the executive in the institutions longer term

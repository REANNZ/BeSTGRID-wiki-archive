; Project Description:

The research interests of the Proteomics & Biomedicine Research group, led by Professor Garth Cooper, include diabetes, cardiovascular and other metabolic diseases, human immunology, and neurodegenerative disorders. 

Garth Cooper’s group has made major advances in the understanding of disease mechanisms in diabetes and related syndromes such as obesity and cardiovascular disease, and based on these mechanisms, to the development of effective new strategies for disease detection and therapy, with an emphasis on prevention of progression. Our group has developed an orally-active molecule which we recently identified and demonstrated to reverse cardiovascular disease in diabetes through regeneration of the diseased heart and arteries. 

Kerry Loomes’ group is interested in myo-inositol oxygenase (MIOX), which is involved in the breakdown of inositol compounds, and whose activity is increased in diabetes. The research has collaborative outreach into structural biology and synthetic chemistry areas and offers a platform for new therapeutic strategies for diabetes. 

Rod Dunbar's team focuses on human immunology. A core project is the design and testing of peptide-based vaccines to stimulate T cells. These vaccines have applications as both therapeutic vaccines for cancer and preventative vaccines for infectious diseases. 

Studies by Shiva Reddy's group focus on the identification of the cellular and molecular processes which underlie destruction of the insulin-producing beta cells during autoimmune type 1 diabetes, and to development of potential therapies which may protect beta cells during the early stages as well as promoting beta cell regeneration after disease onset. 

Russell Snell’s group aims to unravel the molecular mechanisms of simple and complex neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and Spinocerebellar ataxia. Utilizing knowledge of causal genes and their pathways, we are developing model systems with which to investigate the molecular pathogenesis of these disorders and ultimately to screen for and test potential therapeutic agents.

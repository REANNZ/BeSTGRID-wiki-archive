# GridTechWG-20090122

[Grid Technical Working Group](/wiki/spaces/BeSTGRID/pages/3818228403): meeting January 22, 2009.

During this meeting, I would like to share some details about what I've

been working on in the weeks before Christmas - deploying a Shibbolized

Confluence wiki system at University of Canterbury (and finishing some

missing bits in the Shibboleth module for Confluence).

As a result, the University of Canterbury is running a wiki system that,

although primarily targeted at the local user community, can support

inter-institutional (and trans-tasman) collaborations, allowing login from

all users in the AAF Level 2 federation.

Any additional discussion items would be very welcome - please let me know.

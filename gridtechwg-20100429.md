# GridTechWG-20100429

[Grid Technical Working Group](grid-technical-working-group.md): meeting April 29, 2010.

## Program

In this months meeting, Mark Gahegan will give a presentation on the

Invasive Species project.  This will give us an opportunity to think

about how BeSTGRID (the computational grid and the grid middleware) can

support actual projects from specific scientific disciplines.

We will also discuss a deployment strategy for additional iRODS servers in the BeSTGRID DataFabric.

## Minutes

Attending: Vladimir Mencl, Stuart Charters, Mark Gahegan, Aaron Hicks, Mik Black, Kevin Buckley, Peter McGavin, Tim Molteno, Stephen Cope

Mark: invasive species project

- GeoScience: community focused on "how to share data" and "how to analyze"
	
- Need to move on to handling collections
- Earth is multidimensional (unlike a genome) and places effect their neighboring near places

- Mark: problem: simulation with cross-border communication
- Vlad: this is standard domain decomposition

- Mark: asking for contribution with implementing his project - this should be one of BeSTGRID GeoSciences exemplars
- Conclusion: Mark to look for open-source agent-based systems, grid operators to install the system on the grid

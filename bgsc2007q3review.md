## Q3 Report review and discussion

- Nick led discussion of current version of Q3 report, particularly the narrative on delivery of milestones
- Review and feedback by SC members requested by mid afternoon Friday 18th May
- Financials from UA Research Office (Alan MacClachlan) due Thursday 17th May
- Final version to be submitted by UA Research Office to TEC end of day Monday 21st May

***Q4 Report introduction***
- Discussed Q4 outline report as outlining all milestones yet to be achieved, along with several performance indicators to be measured to demonstrate project success.
- Reinforced importance of Q4 in demonstrating project success, and agreed that Q4 will require a larger commitment to SC management and coordination to ensure all milestones and performance indicators are achieved
- Requested that every SC member take the time to review the Q4 outline report over the coming weeks, ready for discussion at the next SC meeting, scheduled for [31st May 2007](bgsc200705.md)

***Formalise Q4 SC Meeting Schedule***
- Discussed need to formalise the SC meetings to ensure broader participation during this crucial quarter
- Proposed and agreed to fortnightly SC meetings, starting [31st May 12__30](bgsc200705.md)

***Massey budget variance***

Chris Messom took this opportunity to advise the SC of an institutional budget variance:
- Major Capex variance:- delay in cluster upgrade. Should be charged next quarter.
- Request for variance in REANNZ connection and R&E Network budget item:-
	
- about $25,000 for two compute nodes to be upgraded to 32GB RAM
		
- This will relieve capacity issues for jobs that use less than 8 cores and that require less than 4GB RAM per processor core
- about $40,000 for additional storage (cluster file system)
		
- Ability to mirror BestGRID databases, reduce disaster recovery time (recovering from tape)

SC approved these variances as fitting with the interests of the BeSTGRID project, and within the discretion of the SC to allow. Paul reminded the SC that its important to discuss variances in institutional budgets at the SC level, so that the SC can approve or escalate budget variances as appropriate. Institutional budget summaries for Q3 will be reviewed at the next SC meeting [31st May 12__30](bgsc200705.md)

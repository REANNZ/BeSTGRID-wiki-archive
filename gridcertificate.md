# GridCertificate

To obtain a grid certificate you need to run the *Grix* tool (this is a Java Web Start application) and follow the instructions *here*, you will as part of the process need to approach an RAO with photo id (driving licence is good) to verify your identity and approve your request. You can find your nearest RAO by checking out this list [http://wiki.arcs.org.au/bin/view/Main/RaoList#NZ_BeSTGRID](http://wiki.arcs.org.au/bin/view/Main/RaoList#NZ_BeSTGRID) .

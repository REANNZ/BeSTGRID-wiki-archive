# Outage Notice 20091127

|  Outage Notice               |
| ---------------------------- |
|  Dear BeSTGRID stakeholders, |

**BeSTGRID wiki will be migrated from MAMS Level 2 into AAF.**

BeSTGRID Wiki login will not work on Friday November 28th (but anonymous browsing will still work).

The MAMS Shibboleth Testbed will be decomissioned on November 30th and all Identity Providers and Service Providers need to be migrated into the AAF Federation by that date.

As a part of this process, the BeSTGRID wiki will be migrated on Friday, November 27th, between 9am and 12pm.

>  ***What**: BeSTGRID wiki migration from MAMS Level 2 into AAF.
>  ***When**: 9am-12pm Friday, 27th November.
>  ***Why**:  MAMS federation is being decomissioned.
>  ***Impact**: Login will not work, but anonymous browsing still will.

There would also be a brief restart of the WAYF server (possibly very briefly affecting login to other BeSTGRID services).

Further Information:

If you have any questions please:

- email Vladimir Mencl vladimir.mencl@canterbury.ac.nz
- phone Vladimir on (03) 364 3012
- email the BeSTGRID Operators bestgrid-operators@list.auckland.ac.nz

Thanks a lot in advance for your understanding. |

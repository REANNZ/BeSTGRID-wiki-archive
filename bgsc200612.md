3. HR process for hiring programmer still moving slowly.
	
1. A new hiring procedure at Massey has caused a backlog of 00's of applications remaining to be processed.

1. TEC - rebid feedback due this week
2. Nick informed that an ICT Academy project was accepted to develop a GridSphere portal for Network Simultion with the [Network Simulation and Design research Group](http://www.ndsg.net.nz)

## New Business / Other

1. Paul signalled that capital expenditure on clusters at Massey and Canterbury is scheduled for early 2007
	
1. Massey
		
1. evaluated cluster nodes already (options: 8 cores / 4 cores / infiniband / large memory)
2. order when next payment comes through in March, or order earlier. Suggested Massey discuss with university whether they can make order earlier given certainty of funds
2. Canterbury
		
1. 20mths on current lease left. if purchase early 2007 then IBM suggest will leave current machine in place and add additional capacity. could purchase new, need to look at options. Could BeSTGRID purchase/own or through CU add to existing cluster
2. existing leased cluster (8 nodes, 16 cores @, 32 GB Ram @), could buy 2 additional nodes
3. need to establish whether we can lease capital equipment, ro do we have to buy, as budget has in capital budget, not operational budget - check with TEC

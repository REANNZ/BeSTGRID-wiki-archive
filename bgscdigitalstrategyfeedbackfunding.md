# Sharing Research Infrastructure

Our opportunity to collect research data in exponentially increasing quantities presents the research sector with challenges of scale, scope, and complexity unapproachable without advanced information and communications technologies. The performance of the required technologies is prescribed by the peaks at which they must run; such systems have as a general requirement the need to have significant spare capacity to facilitate these peak demands. To optimise utilisation of spare capacity requires sophisticated software (middleware) allowing diverse and distributed groups with varied useage patterns shared access to these resources.

The technologies to support sharing of this type of research infrastructure is loosely described within the grid computing domain, although increasingly the boundaries of this definition are being stretched to include security frameworks, collaboration portals, data repositories, and other related technologies. This widening of the definition recognises that, to be effectively deployed, much coordination and integration of each aspect is desireable.

It is interesting to note that New Zealanders have led the development of this revolution in research technology. Hailing from Canterbury, Professor Ian Foster, for much of his career and still currently residing in Chicago and employed at the Argonne national laboratory, is considered the father of grid computing. His work during the mid 90's and until this day recognises the desireability of sharing research infrastructure, and has created the technologies on which a majority of the largest international research collaborations of our day operate.

These research collaborations are characterised by their strategic national or global significance, and bring together the brightest minds in research and science to address problems of fundamental significance to health, education, the environment, nature, our understanding of ourselves, and the micro and macro world around us. To participate these collaborations, and to focus engagement in areas of national concern, national governments have proactively sought to identify areas of strategic importance and national research capability, and put in place programmes of work to create the necessary shared infrastructure required to participate as an equal partner. As partners in these international projects, it is the data sets collected by these national contributors which are represented in the research outputs.

New Zealand has many unique aspects of environment and natural resources, biota, culture, and technology, which are seen as strategic assets. We have strong programmes in support of research in specific areas related to this uniqueness and to our abilities and contributions in related fields. However there are few examples of where these programmes have led to our researchers ability to participate with their colleagues internationally inside these new modes of research collaboration.

The most significant example is the access to a beamline on the Australian Synchotron secured for our research community. It was this investment, along with the investment in a dedicated research and education network, that led to the establishment of the Research Infrastructure Advisory Group, as an artefact of the realisation that no mechanism existed to identify and assess such shared research infrastructure investments. 

The [Research Infrastructure Advisory Group (RIAG)](http://www.morst.govt.nz/current-work/science-infrastructure/research-infrastructure/) provides advice to the Government on cases for non contestable investments in research infrastructure. This process is a reactive one "to provide advice on cases put to the Government for high-cost facilities or equipment needed to support the country’s research and science capability". RIAG was established in 2005, and in 2007 undertook a '[Scan of New Zealand's Large Scale Research Infrastructure Needs 2007-2012](http://www.morst.govt.nz/current-work/science-infrastructure/research-infrastructure/scan-2007-2012/)'. Within the resulting report, delivered in August 2007, RIAG noted the structural issues with funding large scale research infrastructure in New Zealand, and highlighted "the inevitable common themes" running through many of the infrastructure needs identified:

"There are inevitable common themes, High Performance Computing being the most prominent of these, indeed justifying a follow-up sector meeting to examine specific needs in this area."

The scan identifies many [areas of potential infrastructure investment](http://www.morst.govt.nz/current-work/science-infrastructure/research-infrastructure/scan-2007-2012/4/), and admits to not being comprehensive i.e. there are likely to be more. Some of those relevant to developing a coordinated eResearch infrastructure are excerpted below.

- "Environment Sector: High performance computing facilities provision and access, with particular emphasis on advanced climate modelling capability. Need for much higher resolution climate models. Current capability approaching obsolescence - part of a need for wider HPC capabilities linked through KAREN with a range of architecture options. Essential for research across a range of disciplines. 10 - 15 M"
- "Physical sciences (including materials, nanotechnology and energy): Energy: High Performance Computer (several architectures distributed across the country). Many applications across a number of advanced energy and materials based research programmes. See above. 10 - 15 M"
- "Biomolecular platforms and health: High Performance Computing. Many applications across a number of advanced research programmes.  $10 - 15 M"
- "Other facilities brought to RIAG’s attention: Further Development of the KAREN Network: There is already demand to broaden coverage and, in time, capability development will be needed"

It is worth noting that these mostly refer to High Performance Computer (HPC) facilities, with only a terse concluding reference in the last item on the KAREN Network to capability development being needed, in time. The other components of eResearch are left unconsidered, suggesting lack of awareness of eResearch as a fundamental infrastructure. This compares unfavourably to poractive and ongoing Research and Development investment into development of coordinated and shared eResearch infrastructure at the level of 15% p.a. for the last 10 years by the Australian Government.

This is in line with most developed economies, where long term investment in shared eResearch (or e-Science in the EU, or Cyber Infrastructure in the USA) infrastructure is the norm.

Many of the areas identified for potential investment would operate most efficiently on a shared ICT infrastructure, encompassed inside the eResearch domain. This would require a level of coordination across potential proposals not possible while each proposal is considered independently in time. It is therefore recommended that a scoping process is established to analyse the potential for investment in a shared ICT infrastructure suitable for use across large scale research infrastructutre investments.

The current funding available for large scale research infrastructure investments don't have a specific mechanism to support development of shared "cross cutting" research infrastructure, such as eResearch.  

# Notes for this component of the submission

- passive RIAG approach pushes cost of formulating strategy back into community. As eResearch requires a perspective to be taken that sits outside of a specific project, the RIAG process doesn't encourage or directly support moving this sort of common investment forward, as proposals

In our narrative, we'll suggest that any such scoping process should be made aware of the NCRIS programme ([http://www.ncris.dest.gov.au/](http://www.ncris.dest.gov.au/)), and any potential leverage possible through government to government coordination between MoRST and DEST or the new Department of Innovation Industry, Science and Research. This Ministry has centrally funded eResearch in Australia since 2001 ([http://www.dest.gov.au/sectors/research_sector/policies_issues_reviews/key_issues/e_research_consult/default.htm](http://www.dest.gov.au/sectors/research_sector/policies_issues_reviews/key_issues/e_research_consult/default.htm)) including formation of an eResearch Coordinating Committee to advise the Ministry on future directions, which led to NCRIS ([http://www.dest.gov.au/sectors/research_sector/publications_resources/profiles/e_research_strat_imp_framework.htm](http://www.dest.gov.au/sectors/research_sector/publications_resources/profiles/e_research_strat_imp_framework.htm)). The current 5 year NCRIS programme of work is second equal in terms of the size of funding, inside the "Backing Australia's Ability - Building Our Future Through Science and Innovation" [http://backingaus.innovation.gov.au/back_res2004.htm](http://backingaus.innovation.gov.au/back_res2004.htm), and accounts for $540M of a total $3,680.9M investment in the Research and Development area, or 15%([http://backingaus.innovation.gov.au/docs/2004/funding_table04.pdf](http://backingaus.innovation.gov.au/docs/2004/funding_table04.pdf)). This builds on the previous 5 years of investment of $1,637.6M in R&D, with $246M or again 15% focused on eResearch infrastructure.

Outake from DS2 submission:

While there are several and varied generally available frameworks, many open source software, there is always a greater or lesser level of development and customization required to ensure these frameworks and platforms are implemented to meet the specific focus of particular science groups and projects. Internationally, these developments are increasingly leading to long term investments in sustainable services and portals based on automated and up to date scientific analysis, and communities of practice that are continually evolving to adopt new technologies to enhance and enrich their research and practice.

I came across this section of the MoRST website:
[http://www.morst.govt.nz/funding/stable-funding/](http://www.morst.govt.nz/funding/stable-funding/)

which links to some promising materials, 

specifically the media release 'Increased certainty for researchers':
[http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/increased+certainty+researchers](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/increased+certainty+researchers) 

- refers to the $155M available through negotiation (non contestable), which is possibly the area that the RIAG bids are funded from. Nice to know how much is there as a starting point.
- is less promising that this negotiated funding is limited to Research for Industry and Environmental Research. Good for some sciences, not for most, nor for the Arts and Humanities
- Does suggest it covers "supporting our research capabilities"

and also the cabinet paper on the policy changes to support this:
[http://www.morst.govt.nz/publications/a-z/c/cab-paper-effective-investments/](http://www.morst.govt.nz/publications/a-z/c/cab-paper-effective-investments/)

- items like 8.1 and 8.2 seem to work in our favour if looking for CI style funding, and 8.2 in particular supports a focus drawn from existing programmes and analysis, such as the RIAG Scan of New Zealand's Large Scale Research Infrastructure Needs 2007 - 2012 [http://www.morst.govt.nz/current-work/science-infrastructure/research-infrastructure/scan-2007-2012/](http://www.morst.govt.nz/current-work/science-infrastructure/research-infrastructure/scan-2007-2012/) and the NZ Research Agenda ([http://www.morst.govt.nz/publications/policy-discussions/nzra-discussion/](http://www.morst.govt.nz/publications/policy-discussions/nzra-discussion/))

Noting from the first insights into negotiated funding that this fits within specific areas, it would seem that there would need to be structural change to funding to allow a cross capability CI approach to be taken, which would likely need to be driven by the roadmaps for science [http://www.morst.govt.nz/current-work/roadmaps/](http://www.morst.govt.nz/current-work/roadmaps/) and the six Transformational Research, Science, and Technology areas [http://www.morst.govt.nz/current-work/transformational-rst/](http://www.morst.govt.nz/current-work/transformational-rst/). 

MoRST seem to commission reports [http://www.morst.govt.nz/publications/research-reports/](http://www.morst.govt.nz/publications/research-reports/) in specific areas. I'm looking at similar reports coming out of Australia [http://www.dest.gov.au/sectors/research_sector/policies_issues_reviews/key_issues/e_research_consult/](http://www.dest.gov.au/sectors/research_sector/policies_issues_reviews/key_issues/e_research_consult/) (note the Final Report link at the bottom, from 2006, the "essential groundwork" for NCRIS and PfC) as a comparative means to suggest a similar approach is adopted locally.

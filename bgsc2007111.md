- Use Cases discussed were:
			
- AuScope collaborations with AUS, NZ
- Bio Engineering between Oxford and Auckland
- BioPortal, which VPAC / David Bannon is interested in collaborating on
- EVO is nearly shibbolised, increasing ease of access
- Suggestion is to establish a wiki page on BeSTGRID wiki, and ellicit contributions
- Check with Neil James that could also publish capability map
- Paul made notes on his blog [http://www.bonnington.org/?p=47](http://www.bonnington.org/?p=47)
		
- This stimulated conversation on the AAF Mini Grant scheme, which has been seen as critical to establish the capability.
- Agreed to support Neil on his Mini Grant approach
- Nick noted that several smaller organisations were interested in contracting out the IAM work to more capable organisations
- Some of the business drivers weren't clear to some participants at the AAF workshops

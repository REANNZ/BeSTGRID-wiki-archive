=MoRST Grid Middleware proposal= |

# Proposal

## Principles

1. Focus is on grid infrastructure building at BeSTGRID Provider institutions and demonstration through specific research driven applications
2. Participating BeSTGRID Provider institutions must commit hardware resources on a permanent and sustainable basis
3. Research foci must fit with an active researcher(s) at a BeSTGRID Provider institution(s)
4. Focus within any theme or programme of work is on developing sustainable services and shared capability across multiple institutions, requiring any technical lead to proactively identify training and support needs, and undertake related programmes of knowledge and technology transfer
5. Provider and consumer institutions must commit to growing and sustaining the IT capability needed to participate with BestGrid

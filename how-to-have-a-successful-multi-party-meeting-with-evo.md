# How to have a successful multi-party meeting with EVO

# Before the Meeting

- If possible, conduct a short five to 10 minute test session a week or a day before the scheduled meeting
- Be sure to book meetings in the Karen community and not the Universe community
- When booking a meeting, do not use the ad-hoc meeting option in the booking menu.  It is better to book a meeting using the full booking options.  (If you use the ad-hoc meeting option the room has a tendency to be unreliable.)
- Set the start time option well in advance of the actual start time for the meeting.  Remember, the room will not appear until the start time has been reached.
- Make sure all participants realise that they must be connecting to EVO from their office, and not, for example, from home.
- Exchange mobile phone numbers, so that if something does go wrong during the meeting, parties can communicate to resolve it.

# During the meeting

- Audio, audio, audio! If using a Chat50 or 150 read [this section using echo cancellation devices with EVO](https://reannz.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=BeSTGRID&title=Known_Issues_with_EVO&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=3816950847)
- Make sure the participants know how to mute and unmute their audio.  Ask participants to keep the audio muted while they are not talking.
- Make sure participants understand how they can control their 'Audio Transmit Gain'.  Please see [Configuring EVO for the first time](/wiki/spaces/BeSTGRID/pages/3816950603).
- Avoid moving cameras, it is disruptive to the other participants
- Make sure you can see the chat window (lower right of Koala) during the session â€“ important messages are exchanged this way.
- If you lose video streams, during the meeting, try "Restart Video" in the Video Tab, under the AV controls Tab (in the Koala Window).

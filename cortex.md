; Project Description:

Dr Thompson (University of Auckland) is working in collaboration with research teams in Canada (Prof Robert Hess, McGill University, Prof Christian Casanova, University of Montreal) and the USA (Prof Zili Liu, UCLA, Drs Allan Wu and Yoon-Hee Cha, UCLA) on projects exploring the function of visually responsive areas of the human brain. These projects employ functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure neural function, a technique that generates large data sets which need to be accessible to all members of the research team.

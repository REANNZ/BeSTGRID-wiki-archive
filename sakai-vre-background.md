# JISC virtual research environments programme

[JISC funded](http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/themes/eresearch.aspx) the development of the Sakai VRE demonstrator in the UK. 

[JISC allocated a further Â£2 million](http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/vre2.aspx) to Phase 2 of its Virtual Research Environments (VRE) programme, which aims to build and deploy collaborative multi-disciplinary VREs, bringing together tools and technologies to demonstrate how researchers can better manage their increasingly complex tasks.

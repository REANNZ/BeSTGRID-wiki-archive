- Monday 23 July 2007

9.00am (Perth)

11.00 am (AEST)

1.00pm (Auckland)

AARNet with support from NMI-EDIT (Internet2 and EDUCAUSE) and the Asia Pacific Advanced Network (APAN) Middleware Working Group will hold an Ozeconference/information primer for the APAN community on identity management.  This is the third of three sessions on this topic.

## Audience

The audience for this Ozeconference is Directors, Senior Managers, IT Administrators and anyone with an interest in Identity Access Mgt and Middleware within ARENs, Universities and Research organisations.

## Abstract

Sharing data, systems and research infrastructure, in a secure way, between different Australian Research Organisations, such as universities and research agencies presents a difficult problem, both technically and from a policy perspective. There is a lack of technical methods and little or no policy framework to support sharing between organisations, even once technical challenges are overcome.

In order to facilitate the trusted electronic communications and collaboration within and between institutions of higher education and research in Australia, and between these institutions and other organizations worldwide the development of a trust federation in which its members agree to abide by a common set of rules, policies and agreements is necessary.

The Australian Government Department of Education, Science and Training in order to address this requirement is funding a project called the Australian Access Federation (AAF), which will develop the federation policy framework and deploy the infrastructure required to enable access to online resources and services for the Australian higher education and research sector. The infrastructure deployed is based on two technologies: Shibboleth and Public Key Infrastructure. 

The AAF will support a range of services, including authentication and authorization, and builds substantially on the work undertaken by two existing DEST funded projects. These are the e-Security Framework project, based at the University of Queensland, and the MAMS (Meta Access Management System project), based at Macquarie University.

This presentation will provide the background history of the Australian Access Federation (AAF), the progress of the current testbed federation and will discuss the approach to be taken in establishing the AAF.

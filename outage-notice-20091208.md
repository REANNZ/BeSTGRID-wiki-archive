| ---------------------------- |
|  Dear BeSTGRID stakeholders, |

**The Canterbury grid gateway will be upgraded to new release of the operating system and the grid middleware.**

All service on the Canterbury grid gateway will be unavailable on

Tuesday, 8th of December and part of Wednesday, 9th of December.

This is a mandatory upgrade necessary for proper interoperability of the BeSTGRID and ARCS Grid infrastructure.

The services affected are:

- Grid gateway services for the BlueFern systems (and BeSTGRID prototype cluster) - ng2hpc.canterbury.ac.nz and ng2.canterbury.ac.nz
- BeSTGRID BioPortal (ngportal.canterbury.ac.nz)
- Grix - while ngportal is not accessible, the BeSTGRID version of Grix launched via Java WebStart may not start.

>  ***What**: Canterbury grid infrastructure upgraded
>  ***When**: 9am Tuesday, 8th December - 5pm Wednesday, 9th December.
>  ***Why**:  Upgraded required for compatibility.
>  ***Impact**:

- 
- Grid gateway services will be unavailable to submit jobs to the Canterbury resources.
- Jobs already submitted will complete.  Even if their completion will not be recorded by the grid gateway, their contents will be still retrievable.  Email Vladimir Mencl if you need access to the results for jobs completed during the outage.
- Job submission via the portal will not be available.  Grisu submission to other resources will work normally.

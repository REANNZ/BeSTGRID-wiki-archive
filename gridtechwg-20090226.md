# GridTechWG-20090226

[Grid Technical Working Group](/wiki/spaces/BeSTGRID/pages/3816950451): meeting February 26, 2009.

At this meeting, I would like to show what I've been working on for the University of Otago Biochemistry department - grid-enabling ("gridifying") their GenePattern server (a scientific workflow web portal commonly used in their discipline).

In this work, I have used a command-line version of Grisu which Markus Binsteiner developed on-demand for this project - but which is very generic and might be easily used in other projects.

I will first give a demonstration of the portal itself, then move to details on how I made it use the grid, and finally demonstrate the grisu client tool itself.

Any additional discussion items would be very welcome - please let me know!

### BeSTGRID Quarterly TEC Report

- Quarterly TEC report submitted to TEC on 21 February 2008 by Auckland Research Office. Nick apologised for only circulating after the fact due to time pressures.
- Next and final TEC report has several performance measures which need to be discussed and action taken to ensure they can be reported on. Propose a separate meeting with the project leaders of each institution to discuss strategy and put action plan in place. Report back to BeSTGRID SC.

### BeSTGRID Continuity

- BeSTGRID staffing update from member institutions, with specific focus on sustainability of current technical team members beyond February 19th.
	
- Robin noted Vladimir extended for another month, finishing in March. Will continue to push to secure funding, based on REANNZ and TEC ESI bids.
- Mik noted there is an opportunity to work with Otago to extend Vladimirs contract by a further month.
- Chris notes that Anton's contract is winding up as he moves into his PhD. Will continue on 1 day per week, for 2 - 3 months, and then hand over to ESI TEC proposals. Centrally, a work programme is being discussed, from SMT down with Gerrit's sponsorship.
- Mik and Chris have genomics project funded by last REANNZ round. Could make these resources available through BeSTGRID. Test Cluster that Rob has online with R and Optus. Mik and Rob keen to keep Vladimir involved.
- 2.5 positions within central ITS.

### Proposed 'Affilate' status for BeSTGRID in ARCS

- Paul spoken with Rhys Francis and Tony Williams. Both were about to suggest this themselves, so there is support for this approach. Further discussions are planned for the coming weeks to establish what form this might take. Will report back next SC meeting.

### MoRST Federated IAM

- Meeting being held this afternoon. Will report back next SC meeting.

## Progress Reports

### Massey

- Focused on Condor setup
	
- tested in local labs in happy with installation
- looking at flocking of condor clusters with Tim in Otago
- once flocking established, will move image to ITS testing, then across campus. ETC likely mid year
- Gateway machine back up and running, and software running
	
- another of the institutes IT consultant Rushad involved, upskilling
- Rushad looking at VMWare virtual machine as a preferred environment. Chris to update.
- Kiwi genome project, based on BOINC client
	
- working with Alan Wilson Centre to port Blast code to BOINC client. Anton comfortable with Bioinformatics community needs, and well down path for porting code base.

### Canterbury

- AVCC wiki has been shibbolised, a service to the wider community. In process Vladimir bug fixed and matured code base.
- Request from research group, ICECube project, 3 - 4 TBs, while transitting via Christchurch to US. GridFTP at Canterbury now operational to support this project.
- Australian project around tracking grid jobs and reporting back. Local approach with PBS and Load Leveller having an issue with jobs disappearing, which Vladimir has discovered the source of and provided back to the community
- Working with Marcus in VPAC re debugging GRISU
- Robin has approval for a project within ITS on Condor. Looking at working internally first, and would be keen to collaborate as develops.

### Auckland

- Received BeSTGRID Auckland Cluster from SGI. Andrey auditing, planning to rack next week. Install plan available on wiki: [http://www.bestgrid.org/index.php/BeSTGRID_Auckland_Cluster_install_notes](http://www.bestgrid.org/index.php/BeSTGRID_Auckland_Cluster_install_notes)
- new Access Grid room in PostGraduate centre in operation
	
- Struggling with staffing, bookings, for Access Grid sessions. Looking for a sustainable model. Will hold a discussion with interested parties to surface solutions. Please inform Nick of your interest.
- Neil commented that this has been an issue he's been pushing to resolve since 2004. Believes that SCIT is the right forum to sponsor this. Suggests that BeSTGRID could write to the chair of SCIT expressing these concerns. Neil also endorsed a common collaborative approach is required across organisations to make this work.
- Robin referred to the teaching and learning showcase put on Canterbury, which garnered alot of interest. Policy committee has been convened to look at video and conferencing policy in general. Much activity using lifesize.
- Chris notes that Access Grid has remained status quo post the BRCSRA project. Not much else has happened.
- Mik noted the sequencing focused community met via EVO, very successfully.
- Neil noted that Otago's facility is professionally staffed and has been accredited within Nathan's process.
- e-Research Taskforce Report being discussd with VC on Friday. Will update on outcomes next SC meeting or earlier.

## New Business

- New Zealand Genomics Consortium bid going in to MORST. Mik notes that all of these resources will be made available over BeSTGRID. Cluster distributed across Otago, Auckland, AgResearch, and 60TB.

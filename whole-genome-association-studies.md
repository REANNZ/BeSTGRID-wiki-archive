; Project Description:
- Whole genome association scans involve genotypes on genetic markers spanning the human genome in large numbers of individuals with and without a disease, with the aim of identifying genetic variants responsible for increasing disease risk.  The [Wellcome Trust Case Consortium](http://www.wtccc.org.uk) data consist of 500,000 genotypes per individual on 19,000 individuals, with associated quality scores and other relevant information.

# GEON Auckland Workshop

This two day workshop will appeal to domain scientists interested in e-science and cyberinfrastructure, as well as computer and information scientists who have research interests in cyberinfrastructure and grid computing.  Topics will include a detailed look at the workings of a cyberinfrastructure (based around the [Geosciences Network (GEON)](http://www.geongrid.org)), examples of science projects that take advantage of this infrastructure, and descriptions of approaches to data sharing and interoperation (including semantic mediation) that allow scientists to share data more effectively.

### Presenters

**[Dogan Seber](http://atlas.geo.cornell.edu/people/seber/research.html)** ("[Enabling Discoveries in the Earth Sciences Through the Geosciences Network (GEON)](http://sdsugeology.blogspot.com/2007/02/seminar-dogan-seber.html)") and **[Mark Gahegan](http://www.geog.psu.edu/people/gahegan/)** ([College of IST, PSU](http://ist.psu.edu/ist/directory/faculty/?EmployeeID=72)) are working to put together a good balance of geoscience and computer science for the workshop, and are planning to include geoscientists active within the GEON community within the visiting group.

### Topics

Here is a list of quite general topics that the GEON team can cover at the workshop, and that seem appropriate to our emerging needs:

1. CyberInfrastructure (CI) ethos of collaboration, general aims and example projects from different communities
2. GRID technologies, CI middleware & data services
3. The GEON portal and user-level tools & services
4. GEON applications and science projects, including: fossil & climate database, Lidar tools and visualization technologies
5. Data integration tools & web mapping services, ontologies for mediation, knowledge-level computing, cyber-communities

### Draft Program

Please feel free to suggest additions or deletions of topics you would like to see covered.  When I hear back from you and I understand more about what is happening on the first day I'll try to put together a draft program.

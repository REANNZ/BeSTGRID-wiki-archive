# Introduction

[Mono](http://mono-project.com/Main_Page) is a software platform designed to allow developers to easily create cross platform applications. Sponsored by Novell, Mono is an open source implementation of Microsoft's .NET Framework based on the ECMA standards for C# and the Common Language Runtime. 

It permits the compilation and execution of Windows binaries on Linux, though there are some exceptions and exclusions. This is further restricted by the requirements on running applications on clusters.

The current stable version of Mono allows:

- The execution of .NET applications up to version 4.0
- compiling of Visual Basic and C# on Linux
- execution of Windows binary and .dll files on Linux

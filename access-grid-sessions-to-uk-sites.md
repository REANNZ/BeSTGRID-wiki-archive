# Access GRID sessions to UK sites

# Access GRID Support Centre

UKERNA (who run UK's National Research and Education Network 'JANET') have a very helpful [Access GRID Support Centre](http://www.agsc.ja.net)

**UK sites prefer AccessGRID 3.0.2.**

I presume that your AG client software is the Access Grid Toolkit version 3 and that your node operator knows which virtual venue to connect to for the event?

Our virtual venue servers are called

>  fraser.ag.manchester.ac.uk

We have some information for firewall ports at this URL.

In case you cannot see the AGSC Bridge listed, you can switch your AG3 Bridge Registry to display it using instructions at this URL.

If your local node operator needs any further information, they can either ask us or check our website.

# Connecting to University of Oxford

The contact person is Malcolm Harper

The UK Access Grid Support Centre provides an AG3 venue server at

>  [https://sam.ag.manchester.ac.uk:8000/Venues/default](https://sam.ag.manchester.ac.uk:8000/Venues/default)

We can use the "University of Oxford" virtual venue which

can be found in the "UK Venues" lobby.  The venue server provides a

multicast-unicast bridge which you can use by selecting the unicast

option in your venue client after navigating to the venue.

## Testing

One possibility is an unattended test – Oxford can leave their node

switched on overnight tonight, in the University of Oxford venue, with

a radio to provide a sound source and a clock with a moving second

hand.  If you visit the venue during NZ working day you can check

that you are able to receive from us.  

If we can do the same thing

(ie provide an unattended sound and video source) during your

overnight period, they can check whether we can receive from you during

their working day tomorrow.  

There is a jabber room for out of

band communication – please connect to

>         oxford ATATAT conference.mcs.anl.gov

(especially if we don't establish communications with the AG client).

The telephone number in the Oxford Access Grid room is +44 1865 273836.

## The AGSC Test Venue

There's also an AGSC test venue accessible

from the AGSC venues on the AGSC venue server which is rather more

interactive – you should be able to see your video and hear your

audio (with a half second pause).

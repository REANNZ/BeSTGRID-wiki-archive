# GridTechWG-20090528

[Grid Technical Working Group](/wiki/spaces/BeSTGRID/pages/3818228403): meeting April 30, 2009.

Program:

At this meeting, Vladimir gave a broader overview of what is current available on the grid - and also where the grid is heading, as he can tell from his participation in the Australian ARCS's meetings.

He gave a demo of the tools available for the grid - particularly covering new versions of Grix and Grisu, their integration with Shibboleth/SLCS, and also briefly demonstrate the ARCS Data Fabric.

This meeting especially aimed at those who have recently joined the BeSTGRID community to catch up on the grid technology.

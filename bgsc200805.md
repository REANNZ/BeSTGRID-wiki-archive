Posters and demos: 15 August.
	
- In discussion Paul Bonnington around Australian sponsorship.
		
- John Hine, need to gain early commitment from Aus and key stakeholders from this side. Noted that his ADVC-R is Bio scientist and would be interested.
- Gerrit reinforced need to have a session ahead of eResearch Australasia. Noted that Massey Librarian was advocating attendance.
- Robin, Canterbury will have significant representation at APAN. Therefore a good forum.
- GOVIS panel, May 5th, Nick Jones - report back (Nick)
	
- Nick, focus on Green IT issues related to govt procurement
- MoRST Chat Shop, Mark Gahegan
	
- 20th June
- Jenni looking for a larger room
- Victoria eResearch symposium, Victoria University, Mark Gahegan, Neil Gemmel - update (Sam)
	
- 70 ppl. grads, researchers, staff
- e-science focused, including computational financial economists.

#### Funding

- KAREN Institutional Capability Build Fund
	
- signed contracts
- KAREN Capability Build Fund
	
- residual of travel and events funds. Processed 4 applications in last few weeks. Not supporting APAN. Criteria is for 50/50 matching funding, so requires institutional support. UK All Hands, eResearch Australasia. Bringing people in for a tour or a national event. $50 - 60k residual.
- residual in project funds. AgResearch changed which project got funded, so might be residual.
- MoRST eResearch fund - $4.2M - across 3 areas
	
- [Promoting the advancement of knowledge](http://www.morst.govt.nz/funding/budget/#knowledge)
- AVCC booking system
- Remote sites connectivity
- Identity Management
- 2 more
- Gerrit raised issue of BlueFern
	
- Pragmattic shared focus of resource along with meta level of access
- Training and Capability development required at both an institutional and national level
- RIAG proposal updates
	
- No updates.

#### Institutional Capability

- Auckland:
	
- Have an e-Research position looking to fill.
- Massey:
	
- Contract signed, looking for an eResearch coordinator position to be filled. Expecting this to be internal resource to be allocated. Likely not to be fulltime based on funding constraints.
- Forming eResearch Committee to advise on this position, and coordinate across the institution.
- Canterbury:
	
- Vladimir seconded to support BlueFern to cover leave
- Vladimir on leave for a month from Friday, and will return to a new position, thru end of 2008, funded by some work from Otago and internal funding from Canterbury.
- Victoria
	
- Roadmap for VUW, good reception from IT strategy committee last week, and goes to research committee next week. Are applying for Strategic Initiatives funding, which is likely to go ahead, so good progress.
- Otago
	
- No update
- Landcare
	
- Landcare has signed up with REANNZ ICBF
- held first meeting with Crop & Food as is collaborative. Julian Carver is facilitating operations.
- as of yesterday placed an order for a SCENZ Grid cluster, SGI, 100 cores, .4TB RAM, ETA 1st July, 1GB interconnect, dual 4GB connects to storage tek SAN

#### International Collaborations

- Proposed 'Affilate' status for BeSTGRID in ARCS
	
- Tony Williams still tied up preparing ARCS business plan. Have had contact and is still looking to support.

### Federated IAM

- Meeting of the IMAGER committee
- Meeting of the IMAGER Working Group

## Progress Reports

### Massey

- Anton visiting Grid-Ireland
	
- Investigating Grid submission of custom code
- Grid uptake strategy in Ireland
- Kiwi Genome Project
	
- Some sequences available via Otago collaboration
- Allan Wilson sequences in preparation

### Canterbury

- Gateway for SunGrid cluster for engineering department, perhaps will be registered before end of week.

### Auckland

- Auckland BeSTGRID Cluster in final stages of testing after Iteration 3 of installation
	
- have a virtual cluster to test on, and a physical cluster to deploy to
- working with Bioinformatics researchers to deploy BEAST pipeline
- APAN
	
- Telemedicine: fibre rollout delayed due to the big volcanoe in the way. ETA for connectivity to ACSC 20th June. End to End testing
- Discussions with
	
- Visit from VUW security project group to discuss enterprise & research sector IAM
- Biomatters, Bioinformatics Institute, NZSC, about collaborations and technology directions
- Social Sciences research group, reviewing development priorities for a social sciences data portal
- EVO - new vievo beta being tested, great improvement in performance and useability

### Otago

- Tim Molteno is currently arranging for Vladimir to do a month of work "at" (i.e., most of it will be remote) Otago.  Chris Brown is providing funding.  From my perspective work will include adding computational functionality (e.g., Octave, R, plus some specific genomics GRID services) to the Maggie cluster at Otago, issuing GRID certificates, and interaction with Otago's eResearch Advisory Group.  Chris and Tim will also have specific projects.

### Victoria

- Meeting to kick off capability build wiht GNS, now 5 days old. Have a prototype service to deliver GeoNet data
- Meeting re EQC + GNS for a web front to archive models, data, etc. Kicks off 1st July. Working with programmer to establish gateway at VUW to their resources.
- Roadmap for VUW, good reception from IT strategy committee last week, and goes to research committee next week. Are applying for Strategic Initiatives funding, which is likely to go ahead, so good progress.
- Vlad to visit while on holiday, happy to approve certificates at that time. July 9th - 11th.
- VUW IAM project, sponsored by ITS.

## New Business

- Can we revisit the lack of a verification process on BeSTGRID IDM? (Robin)
	
- There is a proposal in front of the IMAGER group on establishing a Level 2 IdP. Options are for an ESAA or AAF based IdP at Level, with incumbent process and policy.

- HD Clients and REANNZ Bridge (Robin)

A three-year project funded by the Health research Council of NZ (HRC). The overall aim of the research proposal is to establish a working, computer-based model of the primary care system in New Zealand in its social context and to test propositions about its functioning and development under

different scenarios of demographic ageing. Advanced methodological techniques will be applied in simulation, modelling, and statistical matching.

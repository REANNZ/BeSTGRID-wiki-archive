; Project Description:

The Research Centre for Cognitive Neuroscience (RCCN) is based within the Department of Psychology at the University of Auckland, New Zealand. The Centre comprises members of staff and graduate students with a common interest in determining the biological bases of mental events in humans. The research conducted by members of the RCCN is diverse, ranging from basic research on cognition and perception, to understanding the neural bases of cognition in healthy adults, to clinical research investigating neural and neuropsychological function in various patient populations. Our research programmes utilize a variety of neuroimaging, cognitive and neuropsychological approaches. 

The purpose of the Centre is to encourage collaborative research, and so increase the likelihood of receiving substantial research funding. The Centre also holds regular research meetings. It is hoped that graduate students working with members of the Centre will benefit from the range of expertise provided, and will themselves contribute to its communal activities.

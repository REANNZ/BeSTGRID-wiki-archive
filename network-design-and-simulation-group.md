; Project Description:

Drs Walker and O'Sullivan have been actively collaborating on automatic SAN Design since 2001. They have developed new mathematical programming formulations for SAN design and pioneered new techniques for solving these formulations. They have published their research in international journals and presented at international conferences. As consultants for HP Labs they developed software for the automatic reprovisioning of SANs in 2002. They have also generated Core-Edge SAN designs for the Content Management System (CECIL) at the University of Auckland.

Currently they are extending this research to include simulation of SANs for evaluation purposes.

# Simple and Secure FTP Data Repository for NZ-based Projects

## Do you have some files or datasets you wish to exchange with your research colleagues within New Zealand and across the globe? Are these files large? 

Then our **simple and secure FTP service** might be what you're looking for.

If you wish to exchange files associated with the research, and no file is larger than 20 MB in size, then you might find [BeSTGRID's SAKAI-VRE](https://reannz.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=BeSTGRID&title=Category__Sakai&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=3818228899) is the right solution for you.

Otherwise, we can establish a secure space on our data grid for your files that you can access through any number FTP clients (including the windows tool: WS_FTP). We will create a 'group' account which you can share with your research colleagues across the globe to access the same file space.  **This is a simple access mechanism.** By exchanging this group password with your colleagues you will be giving the 'key' to access the files and allow them to upload/edit files in return. (Only those with the 'key' will have access to the files).

>  [ftp://groupname:password@ftp.bestgrid.org](ftp://groupname:password@ftp.bestgrid.org)

We can provide up to 100 GB of file space to New Zealand-based researchers.

If you would like to access the service then please contact [Andrey Kharuk](mailto:a.kharuk@auckland.ac.nz)  supplying:

# GridTechWG-20110804

[Grid Technical Working Group](/wiki/spaces/BeSTGRID/pages/3816950451): meeting August 4th, 2011.

## Program

- Gricli release candidate

- New users on the DF: we are getting a number of registrations from outside NZ - should we be imposing quotas on these users?

## Minutes

Attending: Vladimir Mencl, Gene Soudlenkov, Andrey Kharuk, Kevin Buckley, Donald Neal, Mik Black, Aaron Hicks, Stuart Charters, Yuriy Halytskyy

- DataFabric - tracking users:
	
- UoA not providing affiliation, Vlad reports work on this attribute still in progress
- UoA UPI valid for lifetime - includes past students as well, need to know affiliation types - otherwise, the DF is open to all past UoA students...

- Consider quotas on the DF (iRODS level quotas per user, a generous quota of 25GB per user, talk to us if you need more)

- A simple alternative: periodically report current usage (Vlad to do)

- Gricli release candidate: Yuriy could not connect into the EVO session with working audio, postponed to August 18th

## Action items

- Vlad to implement usage reporting for DF

- Proposal for eResearch support team
		
- Bid for strategic funding sent to VUW CFO, PVC Science and DVC Research: they will discuss when DVC Research returns from overseas.
- P3 FTE e-research technical specialists + team leader responsible for project management as well as advocacy work of the kind Sam has done.
- Unit to be located in ITS: pluses around sustainability, accountability, strengths in service management, and ability to leverage existing  infrastructure and capex.
- Some risks around culture change (flexibility, long-term relationships with researchers, openness to open-source and researcher-developed technologies etc) but ITS attitude shifts in last 18 months have been positive.
- Work would include internal support for researchers, as well as work on shared infrastructure (e.g. grid) and with other ITS units on enterprise activities with research impacts (e.g. IAM).
- Seeking 3 years strategic funding; hoping to include programmer time in  bids for external funding to offset some costs by end of that period, and to demonstrate value for internally funded research in other ways.
- Vic on BeSTGRID
		
- Vlad visited VUW. ~6 researchers from SBS will hopefully be APAC-certified and using the BioPortal soon. Most interest shown from Peter Ritchie (phylogenetics), Paul Teesdale-Spittle (chemical binding), Joe Zuccarello (molecular marine biology), and Geoff Chambers (envirogenomics) but also potential for chemical genetics and proteomics in future (perhaps requiring different portlets than the ones currently available).
- Visualisation lab: Screens are working together for still images; SAGE is being installed and then the programmers will start investigating potential uses with researchers.
- Access Grid: Collaborative cello/violin masterclasses with Otago.
- Upcoming professional development events
		
- APAN: In addition to John, Todd Forsythe (ITS Enterprise Architect) now attending. Yannick Behr (PhD student in SGEES, will be working on CBF-funded collaboration with GeoNet) hopefully attending. John and Mark Davies both attending and will seek VPAC certification to become RAOs.
- HPC: Only John attending: Sam's registration transferred to Mark Gahegan.
- Sam's handover activies:
		
- a final report of e-research activities to date
			
- includes KAREN usage stats showing peaks of 3-6 times greater than the entire VUW commodity internet connection and a general upwards trend, particularly since start of 2008
- great increase in use of Access Grid, while VC is steady: more than 1000 hours (400+ sessions of AG and VC have been supported by ITS at VUW since January 2007.
- draft e-research training proposal (under discussion with the Research Office)
- full update of [VUW page on the KAREN wiki](http://wiki.karen.net.nz/index.php/Victoria_University_of_Wellington)
- full update of [VUW e-research website](http://www.mcs.vuw.ac.nz/EResearch/) (currently receiving about 100 visits a day)
- contacts register of all Vic staff and externals that Sam has had contact with: 100+  research staff and grad students as potential users of e-research tools and services; 25+ VUW staff from central service units (ITS, UTDC, Research Office); 50+ external contacts from other research organisations and government agencies such as REANNZ, MoRST, MED, Ministry of Education, NZ Geospatial Office. John will be 'owner' of the register, so if you are needing contacts at VUW for specific activities please get in touch with John to discuss.

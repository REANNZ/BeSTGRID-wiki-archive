# Outage Notice 20091120

|  Outage Notice               |
| ---------------------------- |
|  Dear BeSTGRID stakeholders, |

**An update to Monday’s notification of a service outage this coming weekend.**

Since a loss of service for an entire weekend could be detrimental to many of you, we have reviewed and changed our plans to minimize the impact. As a result only some services will be unavailable over the coming weekend.

Apologies for any inconvenience this may cause.

**[What](https://reannz.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=BeSTGRID&title=What&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=3818228913)**: **Applications and Services server operating system upgrade**

**[When](https://reannz.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=BeSTGRID&title=When&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=3818228913)**: **2 pm Friday, 20th November - 9pm Sunday, 22nd November**

**[Why](https://reannz.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=BeSTGRID&title=Why&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=3818228913)**: The current applications and services server is being upgraded, to come inline with standard operating environments managed within Auckland’s ITS.

The aim is to provide a broader community of support for the services supported on this server, by standardizing the environment, and working more closely with other groups managing similar environments.

**[Impact](https://reannz.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=BeSTGRID&title=Impact&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=3818228913)**: Some applications and services hosted at Auckland will be affected. It will be unlikely that all services will be unavailable throughout the whole change window, but they will be unavailable for periods during this time.

Services hosted at Auckland which will be affected are:

- [Vista and Windows 2008 VMs for Antarctica Research project](http://www.bestgrid.org/index.php/Research_Projects_using_the_BeSTGRID_Data_GRID#Antarctica_Research_Projects)

- [LDAP server for SBSBS project of Laboratory of Structural Biology](http://www.bestgrid.org/index.php/Research_Projects_using_the_BeSTGRID_Data_GRID#SBSBS_project_of_Laboratory_of_Structural_Biology)

Other services, such as the research storage and the compute cluster and associated queues, will be working over this weekend, after an initial short outage at the start of the outage window.

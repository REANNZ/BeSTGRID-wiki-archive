|  1.  |  Determine the Scientific database requirements of the research and education communities (including the biotechnology and bioinformatics communities). Who requires access to what databases, where they are situated, what data are required, how the data will be accessed?                                                   |  Jul 2006  |  Aug 2006  |          |
|  2.  |  Report summarising end-user requirements, providers and possible configurations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |  Aug 2006  |  Sep 2006  |          |
|  3.  |  Develop a strategic plan for the delivery of up-to-date, reliable, and relevant scientific databases to end-users. Meet with system administrators, meet with international providers, meet with potential funding providers, including companies, formulate strategic plan.                                                    |  Sep 2006  |  Dec 2006  |          |
|  4.  |  Prepare/train end-users for appropriate software that capitalises on the GRID computing platforms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |  Oct 2006  |  Dec 2006  |          |
|  5.  |  Report describing strategic plan for the delivery of up-to-date, reliable, and relevant scientific databases to end-users:- Number of sites
- Coordination and synchronisation strategies
- Cost-sharing
- Sustainability
- Future funding
                                                                                     |  Jan 2007  |  Mar 2007  |          |
|  6.  |  Implementation of a distributed search algorithm (e.g., parallel BLAST) to allow more efficient search and access of databases.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |  Mar 2007  |  Apr 2007  |          |
|  7.  |  Implementation of further distributed search algorithms. Extend algorithms to include parallel multiple alignment of sequences, Markov chain Monte Carlo Bayesian estimation of structural and evolutionary models, tree-of-life reconstruction, population genetic software (e.g. LAMARC) and molecular structural modelling.  |  May 2007  |  Jun 2007  |          |

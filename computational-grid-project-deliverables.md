|  1.  |  Establish Computational GRID Management Committee.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |  Jul 2006  |  Aug 2006  |          |
|  2.  |  Link the computational clusters within each of the partner organisations, and begin middleware testing: i.e. Link Massey University’s Helix and sister clusters. Link University of Auckland’s NZIMA and Electrical Engineering clusters.                |  Aug 2006  |  Sep 2006  |          |
|  3.  |  Establish Shared-Memory style high performance computing for computational grid, to complement cluster-style computing                                                                                                                                   |  Aug 2006  |  Sep 2006  |          |
|  4.  |  Establish the user-charging model for computational GRID: This is to allow usage of computational GRID resources to be monitored and charged in an equitable manner. (Full cost recovery based on the existing MU ‘Helix’ cluster user-charging model.)  |  Oct 2006  |  Dec 2006  |          |
|  5.  |  Link the cluster computers based in the University of Auckland and Massey University, and the shared-memory high performance computer                                                                                                                    |  Jan 2007  |  Jun 2007  |          |
|  6.  |  Establish GRID middleware and open access to users of GRID computing.                                                                                                                                                                                    |  Jan 2007  |  Jun 2007  |          |
|  7.  |  Link in the remaining clusters at the University of Canterbury, and connect to GRID middleware (Out of scope of the funding for this project at this time)                                                                                               |  Jul 2007  |  Dec 2007  |          |

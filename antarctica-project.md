; Project Description:

Dr Millar collaborates extensively with Prof David Lambert with his CoRE research focussed in two areas:

The determination of evolutionary and mutation rates in Adelie penguins from the Antarctic. They have used ancient DNA from well preserved Adelie penguin remains in Antarctica to directly measure the rate of DNA evolution. This novel approach has allowed accurate and precise estimates of the rate of evolution. Their present objective is directed at estimating a mutation rate in Adelie penguins. These data in combination, with their earlier estimates of evolutionary rates will provide the first empirical test of neutral theory.

The molecular ecology of the endangered Chatham Island Taiko. The Chatham Island Taiko is one of the world's rarest seabirds and we are using a range of DNA basd techniques to investigate its breeding ecology. Specifically they are investigating the relationship between genetic variation and extinction.

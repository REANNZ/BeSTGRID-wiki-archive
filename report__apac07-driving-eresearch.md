- Robert Woodcock's role, enabling Grid and eResearch infrastructure for GeoSciences
- Investment into developing an infrastructure system - takes a systemic view, with sustainability in mind, seen as a 1 time special deal
- deals with policy, personnel, and other aspects of capability
- crossing state, economic, and organisational boundaries
- GEON has standards and development in data types and components that SEEGrid and AuScope could gain value from

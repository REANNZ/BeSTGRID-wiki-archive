## Abstract

The session aims to build a shared view of the drivers for and issues in achieving collaboration between research groups in Australia and New Zealand, with focus on application level programmes and services as opposed to networks and network related services.

Experience from research programmes in Australia and New Zealand will inform a discussion of opportunities for eResearch collaborations across the Tasman. There will be a discussion on how these collaborations can be facilitated.

These programmes would exploit the AARNet/KAREN networks and the grid and high-performance computing services provided by the APAC partners in Australia and BeSTGRID and major HPC centres in New Zealand.

Categories of application services likely to be involved include:

- Workflows for computational modeling accessing remote data sets
- Global file systems, GridFTP and other fast data access mechanisms
- Collaborative analysis and visualisation
- Mirroring of very large files and databases

The demand for these kinds of services appears in a number of applications that have been developed and use national grids in Australia and the US.

Attendance at the birds of a feather session is by invitation. Please contact the organisers if you would like to contribute or attend.

Members of the Organising Committee:

- Nick Jones (Director BeSTGRID, Manager Centre for eResearch, University of Auckland)
- Paul Bonnington (Director Monash eResearch Centre, Monash University)
- Jenni Harrison (eResearch Advisor, Ministry of Research, Science, Technology, NZ Government)

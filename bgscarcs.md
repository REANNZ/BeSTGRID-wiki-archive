# Australian Research Collaboration Service 

# ARCS affiliate status for BeSTGRID

- Tony finished his business plan, so is now able to put some time into this
	
- has a KPI to establish a formal relationship with a New Zealand partner, which is planned to be BeSTGRID
- Intention is to sign an agreement, not sure what the details of such an agreement would contain
	
- should have an MOU, cooperate on provision of eResearch support and services in Australasia/Oceania
- Ensure that BeSTGRID isn't seen as an offshoot of ARCS, rather it fully recognises BeSTGRID as a self determining partner organisation
- attend ARCS fora as a non voting member, at the ARCS table. However majority of decisions are made through consensus decision making process, therefore can influence in a cooperative way, which Tony sees as optimal for trans tasman collaborations
- can't be seen to push Australian funding across tasman
- EVO proposed as a potential specific service
- grid activity (AAF, Grid Operations Centre) already in place should be included
- Sakai as another service to collaborate on
- Tony noted that AAF and ARCS have a coordination point, where ARCS receives $AUD 2M, to integrate service provision with AAF
- Paul to pass through a template

# ARCS EVO Service

In a previous session with Paul, discussed a potential model for NZ to be supported Tier 2 by ARCS for the EVO service

- ARCS in final stages of signing an agreement with CalTech to become a regional Tier 2 support provider for EVO service
	
- $AUD 60,000 per annum subscription to CalTech
		
- Will lead to creation of a new top level community, AARNET, for the Australian community, although it doesn't contain any exclusion clauses with regards which geographies they can operate within
- ARCS will employ 2 FTE to provide support services and coordinate with CalTech on development initiatives
- $AUD 20,000 p.a. to CalTech to support developments targeted at ARCS needs
		
- first focus will be AAF shibboleth integration with EVO
- ARCS and Monash will trial service, inside the following model
	
- Monash to provide Tier 1 support locally, through employing an FTE as a dedicated support officer and someone who can develop and pilot an institutional support model and resources that can be used at other institutions
- Suggestion that the New Zealand community would be welcomed as a potential subscriber community, supported by the ARCS EVO Service at Tier 2, requiring that our institutions provided local support internally. A cost of $AUD 20,000 was an early figured discussed, but no cost has yet been proposed. This discussion will continue once the initial ARCS Affiliate agreement is in place.

# GridTechWG-20090723

[Grid Technical Working Group](grid-technical-working-group.md): meeting July 23, 2009.

Program:

This meeting was focused on a discussion on Shibboleth - how each institution is progressing towards deploying Shibboleth, and how those with Shibboleth already deployed are progressing towards upgrading to Shibboleth 2.x and migrating to the AAF (Pilot) Federation.

Also, those who were not able to attend the BeSTGRID workshop were updated on its major highlights.

# VoMembership

To request membership of a VO, you need to run the Grix tool (this is a Java Web Start application)

Instructions for using Grix can be found [here](grid-tools.md)

Chances are you'll be wanting membership of the `ARCS/BeSTGRID` VO.

The `ARCS/BeSTGRID` VO is adminstered by a subset of the RAOs in New Zealand so,

once you have requested membership through Grix, a follow-up email to:

`bestgrid-rao`

`at`

`list.auckland.ac.nz`

is advisable
